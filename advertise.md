Each issue of Web Audio Weekly is sent out by email to over 2,000
subscribers and it is one of the most widely-read sources of news for
Web Audio, Web MIDI and related technologies. Many more read the
newsletter on the web. Running an advert in Web Audio Weekly is a great
way to hire a new developer or promote a product.

I only run a maximum of 1 advert per issue. Here's what you need to
know:

- An advert costs £199
- You have space for around 100 words and a link in the main body of
  Web Audio Weekly. Your post will be marked as "sponsored".
- Your advertisement will be included in the next available issue or
  in a specific week you choose
- Your advert will also appear permanently in the archive on this site
- I will mention your job vacancy or service on the
  [@webaudioweekly](https://twitter.com/webaudioweekly) twitter
  account.

To advertise contact me by email at
[advertise@webaudioweekly.com](mailto:advertise@webaudioweekly.com)
and we'll sort out the details.
