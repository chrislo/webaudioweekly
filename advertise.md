Web Audio Weekly reaches almost 2,000 subscribers per issue and is one of the most widely-read sources of news for Web Audio, Web MIDI and related technologies. Running an advert in Web Audio Weekly is a great way to hire a new developer or promote a product.

I only run a maximum of 1 advert per issue. Here's what you need to know:

- An advert costs Â£199 + VAT
- You have space for around 100 words and a link in the main body of Web Audio Weekly. Your post will be marked as "sponsored".
- Your advertisement will be included in the next available issue or in a specific week you choose
- Your advert will also appear permanently in the archive on this site
- I will mention your job vacancy or service on the [@webaudioweekly](https://twitter.com/webaudioweekly) twitter account.

To advertise contact me by email at [advertise@webaudioweekly.com](mailto:advertise@webaudioweekly.com) and we'll sort out the details.
