## BlockDust ##

BlokDust is a very stylish web-based music making app. By joining
blocks together, you can build synthesizers, put effects on your
voice, remix & manipulate samples and arrange self-playing musical
environments. The built in tutorial gets you over the initial learning
curve. You can hook up MIDI controllers to help create your
instruments, and share the results on social networks. It is made by
three developers in Brighton, UK, who have also made the code open
source.

## Google's Omnitone: Spatial audio on the web ##

Google's new Omnitone project is a first-order ambisonic decoder that
allows you to binaurally render an ambisonic recording directly in the
browser. This means that sound that has been designed for a
multi-channel surround-sound speaker setup can be experienced using a
standard set of headphones.

Hongchan Choi and Raymond Toy, the authors, gave me a demonstration of
the technology using Google's "cardboard" VR setup, and it really is
impressive. The positioning of the audio maps well to what the eyes
can see in the virtual environment, tracking head movements and object
movements in the 3D space very well.

Get the full technical details and demos at Google's opensource blog
and the Omnitone project page.

## What's new in Web Audio ##

Mozilla's [Sole PenadÃ©s](https://soledadpenades.com/) takes a look at
the new Web Audio features and performance enhancements that have been
introduced in Mozilla's Firefox browser in the last 12 months. This
includes a useful overview of the `disconnect` methods on audio
nodes, the changes to lifecycle management of `AudioContext` and the
move towards a more contructable syntax for node creation.

## Guitar Amp Simulator in Web Audio ##

Michel Buffa has been pushing the boundaries of amplifier simulation
creating ever-more realistic simulations using Web Audio. Michel
describes the latest version of his guitar amp simulator:

> With the help of the famous native amp sim coder LePou, we cloned the
> Marshall JCM 800 premp schematic with WebAudio (tonestack, filters
> between the preamp stages etc.). I also used asymetric + symetric
> transfer functions for the two distortions in order to generate both
> odd and even harmonics in a suitable way.

If you don't have a suitable audio interface and electric guitar, the
YouTube video has a good demonstration.

## midi-ports ##

The midi-ports library provides a very useful set of simplifications
and abstractions on top of the Web MIDI API allowing you to access
devices by name as well as group ports by device.

## genish.js tutorial ##

Charlie Roberts has written a comprehensive tutorial for their
`genish.js` synthesis library. `genish.js` uses the Web Audio API to
playback sound, but permits sample-by-sample manipulation of the
audio. This allows some types of synthesis techniques that are
impossible using Web Audio nodes - such as single-sample delay
lines. To keep performance acceptable, `genish.js` optimises the
generated JavaScript.

## What does the harmonic series sound like? ##

A simple but effective demonstration of the principles of
[musical harmonics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_series_(mathematics))
from Google Create Lab's [Alexander Chen](http://www.chenalexander.com/).

## Thoughts on improving Web Audio ##

Carl Tashian has been playing with the Web Audio API and has some
thoughts on how things could be improved. Most of Carl's points relate
to extension libraries and possibilities for Web Audio-based
technology rather than the API itself, but if you're working on tools
for other developers to use, Carl has some interesting ideas.

## Talking Machines interview Doug Eck about Generative Art ##

In this episode of the excellent Talking Machines podcast Katherine
Gorman interviews Doug Eck of Google's Magenta project. They discuss
the future of computer-generated art and music made possible by
advances in neural networks and machine learning. The interview with
Doug Eck starts at 15:30.
