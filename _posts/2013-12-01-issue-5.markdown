## Word Problems ##

Part of the Chrome Experiments series of demos, Felix Turner combines
Web Audio and WebGL (using three.js) to create visualisations synced
with music. The accompanying blog post is really instructive as he
explains how the beat detection algorithm works and how it is
implemented using Web Audio.

## Audio Tags: Web Components + Web Audio ##

In this talk from the CascadiaJS conference Soledad Penad√©s from
Mozilla proposes a really interesting idea for building Web Audio
applications by combining web audio with web components. The latter
technology allows us to add custom tags which can have custom
behaviour attached to them. Soledad expands on this concept to create
the idea of Web Audio Components which allow audio applications to be
created in markup, for example:

```
<audio-context>
  <audio-chain>
    <audio-oscillator frequency="220"></audio-oscillator>
    <audio-waveshaper></audio-waveshaper>
    <audio-oscilloscope></audio-oscilloscope>
    <audio-vumeter></audio-vumeter>
  </audio-chain>
</audio-context>
```

It's a really interesting idea, and a great hack which brings together
two web technologies in a surprising way. The presentation also
includes an interesting section on the history of Google and Mozilla's
Audio APIs and how the Web Audio API came to be implemented in
Firefox.

## This Exquisite Music Engine ##

Swedish creative web studio DinahMoe worked on the audio engine for a
collaborative art project called Exquisite Forest. This demo allows
you to play with the audio engine to generate endless music from
simple parameters.

## Peaks.js ##

The BBC have an internal software tool which allows staff to clip out
sections of video for reuse from their extensive video archive. As
part of adding audio support to the tool to make it usable for radio
production, my former colleagues in R&D have open-sourced this
waveform editor and generator. It looks to be a really useful library
for building web-based audio applications with. More details and links
to the source code can be found in their blog post.

## Instant Audio Processing Book ##

This new book from Chris Khoo gives an introduction to the Web Audio
API by showing how to build some small applications - a looping audio
player and an equaliser. Chris takes us through the building of the
application from setting up a web server to writing the HTML
interface. There's a nice section talking about the Bi-quad filter node
in the Web Audio API, and how different types of filter work. The book
reads more like a collection of blog posts than a comprehensive
overview of Web Audio, but for those that prefer something longer form
to read and program along with, its a good place to start. It's good
that we're starting to see coverage of the technology in books as well
as on the web.

Disclaimer: I received a complimentary review copy of this book.
