## NexusUI 2.0

Ben Taylor has released version 2 of NexusUI - a library for creating user interfaces for Web Audio applications. Buttons, dials, sliders and toggles are provided as well as some more audio-specific elements such as a grid sequencer and oscilloscope. The library has had a ground-up rewrite resulting in a cleaner, more intuitive API - so it's a perfect time to take a look even if you've used Nexus before.

## Tune Status

In Tune Status a unique piece of music is generated based on live data from London's transport network. The better the service the more harmonious the music. Discord ensues as lines are suspended and trains are delayed.
