## Tones ##

A beautifully-executed collaborative music-making application. As well as creating your own tunes and playing around with the built-in effects and synth options, take time to click the "burger" menu and listen to some of the pieces other people have created.

## NSynth ##

An interesting project from Google that combines DIY hardware with some cutting-edge machine learning from the Magenta group.

> NSynth Super is part of an ongoing experiment by Magenta: a research project within Google that explores how machine learning tools can help artists create art and music in new ways... Itâ€™s an open source experimental instrument which gives musicians the ability to make music using completely new sounds generated by the NSynth algorithm from 4 different source sounds.
