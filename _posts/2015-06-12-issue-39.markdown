## Recreating the Birdman opening credits with the Web Audio API ##

Mark DiMarco has recreated the opening credits of the recent Alejandro
González Iñárritu film Birdman using the Web Audio API. He uses beat
detection to synchronise the jazz drumming with the appearance of the
letters on screen. The code and some technical details are on
github. Fantastic stuff!

## Web Audio premiere at the València Vox Festival ##

Ben Houge wrote in to tell me about recent premiere of a piece of
music that relied on the Web Audio API to immerse the performances and
audience in a collective experience

> The Berklee Valencia App Choir, an ensemble I founded last year as
> part of Berklee's Music Technology Innovation master's program at our
> campus here in Valencia, Spain, premiered my new piece "Ornithological
> Blogpoem," a setting of a poem by Elisa Gabbert, at the first Vox
> Festival, an event we organized around the visit of the great computer
> music pioneer John Chowning.
>
> My piece is very similar in structure to "The Tomb of the Grammarian
> Lysias," which I presented at the first WAC last January, only now
> with a choir of singers.  The piece has 3 technical components.
> Singers have a web app that displays each phrase of the piece in
> standard musical notation; the singers' parts are unsynchronized, and
> the app supplies different timings and repetitions of phrases for each
> singer.  The audience has another app that plays fragments of the
> singers' voices at different pitches, resulting in a gradually
> building texture distributed throughout the venue that towards the end
> of the piece evokes a tree full of chirping birds.  I have a third web
> app that I use to step through different sections of the piece and
> control everything.

Ben has written more about his earlier work "The Tomb of the
Grammarian Lysias" on his blog, and a recent article from Priceonomics
gives a great introduction to the life and work of John Chowning.

## Music Visualisation with p5.js ##

Jason Sigal regulary runs a workshop on visualising music using the
Web Audio API and his p5.js library. He's made the slides, code and
all of the demos available on Github, and they are a fantastic
resource for learning how to syncronise visuals with audio using time
and frequency domain analysis, beat detection, pitch tracking and
other techniques.

## The 2nd Web Audio Conference - Call for Submissions ##

The 2nd Web Audio Conference will be held April 4-6 2016 at Georgia

the first conference in Paris earlier this year, they welcome
submissions from developers, musicians, artists and researchers.

## Browser MIDI Is About Hardware As Much As Music ##

An interesting perspective from musician and developer Giles Bowkett
on how the Web MIDI API isn't just about music, it also allows our
browsers to be controlled with a much wider range of interfaces than
previously possible.

If you're interested in catching up on what's possible with Web MIDI,
Create Digital magazine have recently published a great overview.

## Midem Hackday ##

The music industry event Midem in Cannes featured a hackday where
developers worked on musical applications in 48 hours. The Midem blog
has a full round up together with videos of the demos, and of
particular interest to Web Audio developers is Ben Fields, Sam Phippen
and Hugh Rawlinson's hack rMIXr, an in-browser DAW for remixing
contests.

## A quick correction ##

One of the developers on the Microsoft Edge browser project got in
touch to say that they will be supporting `ScriptProcessorNode`, after
I mistakenly reported them as not doing so last week. They're keeping
a keen eye on the proposed Audio Worker replacement though, and intend
to move forward with that and deprecate `ScriptProcessorNode` as soon
as they are able to.

## The sound of dialup ##

Do you remember connecting to the internet using a dialup connection?
Ever wondered what those weird sounds meant? Wonder no more!
