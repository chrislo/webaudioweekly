## Internet has a Cat! Meet Purrli

> The sound of a purring cat is one of the most comforting sounds
> available and can help soothe and calm you down when you're feeling
> stressed. Naturally, it's not just the sound that is important, but
> it's also the presence of the warm cuddly cat. Purrli tries to
> recreate both the sound and the presence of your very own virtual cat
> through a custom sound engine modelled after real purrs.

## What else can we do with the Web Audio API

Christoph Guttandin has written up his talk from last year's Web Audio
Conference in which he explores some unusual calculations that can be
performed with the Web Audio API and how their performance compares to
pure JavaScript.

## Banger.fm

Banger.FM:

>  uses the web audio API to create a webapp that allows you to make
>  sounds, beats, and songs quickly (using lots of keyboard shortcuts)
>  so that you can DJ live. Also, it allows for realtime multiplayer
>  interaction (that's the beauty of the internet I guess) - make
>  music with a friend, or remotely for a distributed audience

## How sound design can add texture to a virtual world

In immersive VR worlds the quality of the sound design can make or
break the experience. This interesting essay explores the importance
of sound design to virtual reality environments.

## Holdspace

Carlos Yusim's "Holdspace" is a monochromatic artwork combining vector
art with generated soundscapes.

## Slytherin - SSS - Steev's Soft Synth

An exploration of additive synthesis showing how familiar and complex
sounds can be generated by combining sine waves.

## BassApp

On online tool to help bass players learn and share basslines. The
application has bass-specific notation and an interface to allow you
to practice the lines at your own pace.

## National Park Service Remix

Ambient soundscapes created using public domain samples from the US
National Park Service and the Web Audio API.

## NSynth

NSynth is a new synthesis technique that uses Neural Networks (via
Tensorflow) to learn how to generate sounds based on training
data. One of the really interesting features of this approach is the
ability to learn features of the input sounds which can then be
manipulated - to generate time-stretched versions of the inputs for
example.

I think the low-bit rate quality of the output audio belies the power
of this technology. It's unusual for a truly new approach to synthesis
to be developed and this, as the author states, is probably "one of
the most exciting developments in audio synthesis since granular and
concatenative synthesis".

## I never sleep, ‘cause sleep is the cousin of death

My son is having a hard time sleeping unless someone holds him which
means he and I have been spending plenty of time catching up on
Netflix's back catalogue of music documentaries. I particularly
enjoyed One9's film about one of my favourite records: Nas's seminal
1994 album Illmatic.
