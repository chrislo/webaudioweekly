- [Simulation software automatically creates the sounds emanating from virtual objects](https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/08/simulation-software-automatically-creates-the-sounds-emanating-from-virtual-objects/): Computers are now capable of creating incredible, almost life-like simulations of virtual scenes. But creating the corresponding audio to go along with them is hard. Academics at Stanford are working on the problem. There's more information and video demos on [the paper's website](https://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/wavesolver/) /via [HoT4Radio](https://mobile.twitter.com/HoT4Radio)
