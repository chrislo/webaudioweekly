## An introduction to Web MIDI and Web Audio ##

This blog post from Stéphane Péricat is a comprehensive introduction
to building applications that combine the Web Audio API with the Web
MIDI API - allowing you to build applications that can be controlled
by MIDI hardware. There's not a lot of documentation for the Web MIDI
API out there yet, mainly due to its limited support in existing
browsers (only Chrome has support at the moment). But tutorials such
as this should let developers build some compelling demos of the
potentials of the API.

## Audio Visualisation with the Web Audio API ##

A fun, clear tutorial that shows how to create animations that are
synchronised to sound by leveraging the built in frequency analysis
provided by the Web Audio API's AnalyserNode.

## Experiments with DART and Web Audio ##

William Quartz wrote to tell me about his experiments building up the
audio capabilities for his game engine using the new language Dart. In
doing so, he's created a JavaScript version which can be generated
from the Dart code. To be fair, I don't have any experience of Dart or
how to get this working, but it's interesting to see how William has
been able to generate complex Web Audio API Node graphs from his Dart
code. Worth digging into in more detail if you're a Dart fan.

## More highlights from the Web Audio Conference ##

Bill Walker shares his personal highlights from last month's
International Web Audio Conference in Paris. There's a lot of great
talks, libraries and papers to explore from the event! Also, if you're
a new subscriber to WAW you may have missed my write up of the
conference from last week, so go and have a read of that too.

## Web Audio Developer Tools for Chrome ##

[Stuart Memo](http://stuartmemo.com/) opened a bug for Chrome
bemoaning the lack of developer tools for Web Audio, similar to the
wonderful
[Web Audio Editor in Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Audio_Editor). Worth
a shot, Stuart!

## WebAudioSynth V2 ##

A Web Audio synth inspired by the MiniMoog and rendered in glorious 3D
using WebGL. I love the lighting effects when you hover over the
controls, and the animated key presses on the keyboard.

## Music Thing ##

Music Thing is an open-source DIY modular synth toolkit, with full
schematics and part lists available to view and clone on
Github. There's a lot of great synth demos on the site and I
particularly love the
