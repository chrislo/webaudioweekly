## Web Audio API coming to Internet Explorer ##

The Next Web is reporting that Microsoft have announced that they are
working on support for the Web Audio API in a future version of
Internet Explorer, the browser that ships as standard with Microsoft
Windows. This is great news for developers who want to build
applications using the API, and good news for the technology itself as
another inter-operable implementation will help drive the
standardisation process. The W3C Audio Working Group
[haven't had contact from Microsoft](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-audio/2014AprJun/0065.html)
at this time, but the
[Modern IE status page](http://status.modern.ie/webaudioapi) is
indicating that Web Audio is under development.

## Chrome Cube Lab ##

The Chrome Cube Lab is a collection of hacks and variations of
Google's recent
[Rubik's cube doodle](https://www.google.com/doodles/rubiks-cube). There's
a couple of experiments that use Web Audio. Synth cube synchronises
music and visuals with the rotation of the parts of the cube, and I
loved 808cube which turns the cube into a drum machine. Once you've
created a pattern you like, spin the parts of the cube to create
interesting variations.

## An interview with Adrian Holovaty of Soundslice ##

I linked to Soundslice, the Web Audio-powered sheet music application,
in a previous issue of this newsletter. I caught up with the founder
Adrian Holovaty and asked him some questions about his experiences
working with the technology on a large commercial project.

## Sophisticated Analogue Synth in Soundtrap ##

Soundtrap, the collaborative digital audio workstation, have added a
new instrument to their application. It's a sophisticated analogue
synthesiser featuring two oscillators and some interesting LFO
possibilities (including noise and sample-and-hold waveforms). You'll
need a Soundtrap account to try it out, and sadly there's no details
on the technical implementation - but from playing around with it it
seems rock-solid and very responsive, so it makes for a good example
of what is possible with the Web Audio API at the moment.

## BHUMP : an HTML5 Multitrack player ##

An experimental multi-track recording application from Michel
Buffa. The application itself is in the early stages but Michel plans
to tidy up and open-source the code shortly, so it's certainly worth
keeping an eye on if you're thinking of building something similar.

## Laurie Spiegel plays the Alles synth ##

The Bell Labs
[Alles synthesiser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs_Digital_Synthesizer)
was one of the first purely digital synthesisers. In this video from
1977, Laurie Spiegel, American electronic music composer, plays the
synth and creates some wonderful analogue-sounding drones.
