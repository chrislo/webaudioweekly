## Friday night is music night remixed ##

For a special performance of film music broadcast by BBC Radio 2, BBC
R&D created a prototype that allows the listener to 'zoom in' on
sections of the orchestra. A total of 4 individual mixes of the
recording were made and by zooming in on the video, the balance
between the four is changed - this allows you to hear the strings,
brass, woodwind or percussion in more detail.

## Clubberize ##

[Clubber](https://github.com/wizgrav/clubber/) is a library for the
visualization of sound using frequency analysis. It abstracts away a
lot of the complexity in building this kind of
application. [Clubberize](https://github.com/wizgrav/clubberize) wraps
a lot of the code in a modular way that makes it easy to use in your own projects.

## Web Audio benchmarks ##

A suite of benchmarks designed to test the performance of "native" Web
Audio code against various other methods of synthesising sound -
including `ScriptProcessorNode` in the main thread, on a worker thread
and using `WebAssembly`. This type of benchmark should be very useful
when `ScriptProcessorNode` is eventually replaced with an
`AudioWorklet` node.
