## Sound Design in Web Audio ##

I love articles about sound design, the process of creating new sounds
from scratch using simple synthesis building blocks. In this in-depth
two-part article Nick Thompson recreates the bass sounds common in
"NeuroFunk" music using a subtractive synthesis approach. There's some
great theoretical detail about resampling, waveshaping and oscillator
phasing as well as loads of code to dig into. Great stuff!

## Senior Frontend Developer for IDAGIO ##
### Sponsored post ###

Our mission at IDAGIO is to help classical music become a leader in the
digital entertainment market. We work with some of the world's leading
musicians, including the Vienna Philharmonic and the London Philharmonia
Orchestra. Within the next weeks we will gradually roll out our web app
into beta testing. As a senior frontend developer you join a small,
interdisciplinary team that builds and owns all aspects of this app. We use
a technology stack based around React, Redux and Node.js.

The job is based in Berlin, full-time. We do offer help with visas and
relocation.

## A Tale of no clocks ##

Joe Sullivan discusses the use of offline audio rendering in this blog
post. The article talks about a variation of the all-at-once
scheduling strategy, as outlined in Chris Wilson's blog post 'A tale
of two clocks', that works particularly well with loops. It avoids
on-going interaction with the UI thread by scheduling events in
advance for offline rendering in an OfflineAudioContext. As we start
to build more sophisticated applications in Web Audio, performance
will become more and more important and articles like this will be
incredibly useful.

## Visualising audio waveforms in polar coordinates ##

This project from Matt DesLauriers generates beautiful visualisations
in real time using Canvas2D and the Web Audio API. On the
[demo page](http://mattdesl.github.io/spins/), if you open up a
console, you can change the parameters and choose a different
Soundcloud track to render.

## The Pentaphone ##

We first met Bill Gathen's Pentaphone back in
[issue 33](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw/2015/02/28/web-audio-weekly-33.html). It's
a music performance tool that uses pentatonic scales to make it easier
to play great-sounding harmonies and chord sequences. Bill's updated
the app, using the Web MIDI API, to support Novation's Launchpad MIDI
controller. If you have one of those the video tutorial shows you how
to use it with Pentaphone.

## Virtual Audio Graph ##

Virtual Audio Graph is library by Ben Hall for the declarative
manipulation of Web Audio node graphs, in a similar way to how
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) or the
[virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) work for the
HTML DOM API. Rather than connecting nodes together using the
standard, imperative calls to the API, we can instead declare the
state we want the node graph to be in, for example:

<pre>
<code>
virtualAudioGraph.update({
  0: ['oscillator', 'output'],
  1: ['gain', {key: 0, destination: 'frequency'}, {gain: 10}],
  2: ['oscillator', [1, 'output'], {type: 'triangle', frequency: 1}],
});
</code>
</pre>

and the library will figure out the changes it needs to make to
achieve this. It's a very interesting approach, and if you want to see
how the library works in practice it's worth reading the code for
Ben's 'Elemental' synth which uses this library.

## iOS 9 Problems with Web Audio ##

With the release of Apple's iOS9 operating system some developers have
noticed issues with Web Audio applications and 'user initiated
interactions'. Adrian Holovarty is collecting some resources and
workarounds as they appear.

## Creating UIs for the Web Audio API ##

A talk from Stephen Band at the SwissJS conference on creating user
interfaces for live music performance using the Web Audio API. The
talk starts with a live performance for saxophone and browsers,
introduces the concepts of the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs, and then
goes on to introduce `sound.io` a live-performance tool which allows
on-the-fly modification of microphone input.
