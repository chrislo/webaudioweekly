## Web Audio and 3D Soundscapes ##

A great tutorial on using the spatial-positioning features of the Web
Audio API for game developers. It discusses how to load sounds and
then arrange for them to play as if they were positioned somewhere in
the 3-dimensional space surrounding the listener.

## Web Audio Timing Tutorial ##

The Web Audio API provides an accurate, predictable clock for
triggering audio events. This is very important when building
applications which require a steady rhythm, for example a drum
machine. One of the issues you'll face in building this kind of
application is how to synchronise the Web Audio clock with the regular
JavaScript timer to allow changes in the user interface to influence
the audio playback. This tutorial walks through the creation of a drum
sequencer with particular emphasis on the timing aspects.

## Tools for the 21st century musician ##

Soledad Penad√©s gave a great presentation at the Full Frontal
JavaScript Conference in Brighton this year. The video of her talk is
now on YouTube and Soledad has put the slides online too. A great
intro to the Web Audio API for newcomers, and an introduction to the
[OpenMusic](https://github.com/openmusic) Web Audio toolkit for more
experienced developers.

## Visualisations of live radio streams ##

An experimental mash-up of live radio streams, sound analysis using
the Web Audio API and animated GIFs. This seems to work on Google
Canary only for now, although it will load without audio on FF
nightly.
