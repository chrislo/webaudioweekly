## HTML5 Web Audio API becomes Candidate Recommendation

This happened last Autumn, but I haven't mentioned it in the newsletter yet. The W3C Web Audio API specification is now a Candidate Recommendation. This is effectively a "feature freeze" for the version 1 of the specification - to give chance for interested parties to offer feedback based on implementations of the spec. It also acts as a line in the sand for the Audio Group to [start collecting ideas for the next version](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Proposed+v.next%22). I know how hard the whole team have worked on getting the spec to this point, in particular the editors and chairs at the time Raymond, Paul, Matt and Joe. Amazing work everyone!

## Audio snapshot testing

If you're looking for a technique to help you write automated tests for your web audio application one approach is to compare the generated audio output with a known-good "snapshot". This github repo is a proof-of-concept of that approach.
