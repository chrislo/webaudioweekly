## Visualising birdsong with Web Audio ##

In this article Jim Vallandingham takes some simple, beautiful
illustrations of bird song from an old book and creates a modern-day
D3.js and Web Audio-powered interpretation. The resulting graphs show
the frequency content of each individual chirp as a spectogram (a
representation of the frequency content of sound), but arranged over
time to give an indication of the rhythm of the whole bird song. The
script processor and analyser nodes provided by the Web Audio API are
used for the analysis, and canvas and SVG are used together for the
visualisation.

## Making charts accessible using the Web Audio API ##

Doug Schepers, of the W3C, has been experimenting with using the Web
Audio API to "play" the shape of SVG graphics. He's particularly
interested in using this technology to make data visualisations more
accessible to visually-impaired users by allowing them to hear the
"shape" of a curve in a line plot. Doug demo'd this at the FluentJS
conference this week, and there's some code to play with on Github.

## Audio Tags: Web Components + Web Audio ##

We covered Soledad Penad√©s innovative Audio Tags concept back in
[WAW #5](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw/2013/12/01/web-audio-weekly-5.html),
when she presented at the CascadiaJS conference. Briefly, it's a way
to define custom tags which can have associated audio behaviour and be
combined in clever ways to build audio applications. She's now written
up the idea on the Mozilla blog, complete with working demos.

## Generative music with graphs ##

I really enjoyed this experiment from Szymon Kaliski. Click on the
screen to add nodes, and drag between them to connect. Small blobs
travelling between the nodes trigger sounds, with their pitch based on
the distance of travel. You can create some interesting rhythmic
compositions without the constraints of the typical "grid" structure
used by a lot of audio software. The code is also available of Github
and makes for interesting reading.

## "like jQuery for your ears" ##

WAD, which stands for Web Audio Digital Workstation, is a higher-level
javascript library around the Web Audio API. It has a terser syntax
for loading a source node and playing it, and some powerful
constructor functions which create small web audio graphs for common
synthesiser-type sounds.

## Steve Reich: "Don't tell me you don't have the right equipment" ##

In this video profile of the minimalist composer Steve Reich he
discusses the importance of musical imagination over access to the
latest, greatest equipment. We might not be able to do everything we'd
like to do with audio on the web yet, but this is a reminder that with
simple tools and imagination wonderful music is possible.
