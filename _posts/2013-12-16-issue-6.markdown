## Make your browser dance ##

24 ways "is the advent calendar for web geeks", and each article
explores something new and exciting from the world of web
development. In this article Ruth John creates a visualisation using
CSS animations and the Web Audio API. She goes into some depth on how
to analyse the audio to extract timing information and then how to
syncronise the visuals with the music. The resulting demo is visually
simple, but very effective.

## Octahedrone ##

Another visualisation synced to the audio using the Web Audio
API. This one uses WebGL and generates all of the sounds in response
to mouse clicks. I was quite impressed with how smooth and glitch-free
the sound was, but it does require a fairly fast computer. The author Ehsan Ziya has some more demos on his site which are well worth checking out.

## Listen Up! Binaural Sound ##

When positioning sound spatially using the Web Audio API, you can use
the PannerNode. In it's simplest form sound can be positioned by
cross-fading the left and right stereo channels. But there are more
sophisticated and realistic ways to achieve the effect. In this
article Chris Pike of BBC R&D talks about the history of Binaural
Sound, and some of the latest advances in the technology. While not
Web Audio specific the article should give you some of the background
you need to understand a bit more about how the "HRTF" option in the
PannerNode is implemented.

## Everything You Need to Know About playbackRate ##

In this post, Mark Boas talks about playbackRate, which is an option
supported on HTML audio and video tags to adjust the playback
speed. The cross-browser support is variable, and Mark explains how to
use it and what level of support you can expect from the various
browsers out there.

## LiveCamp ##

TOPLAP is a collective who encourage and support live coding - the art
form which combines performance and code. They're organising an
"informal summer camp" in 2014, which looks like a lot of fun.

## Algorithmic Music subreddit ##

I'm interested in computer programmes which can generate music, and
especially in bringing some of the class algorithmic music techniques
to the web. This subreddit seems to have a high signal to noise ratio, and a lot of interesting links.
