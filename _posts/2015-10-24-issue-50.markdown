## midi.space ##

midi.space shows how friction-less applications built with the new Web
MIDI API will be compared to their legacy, desktop-software
counterparts. Open the browser, connect your MIDI devices, drop some
samples onto the on-screen pads and start creating loop-based
music. If you don't have a MIDI device, you can use your
mouse/trackpad to trigger the samples.

## The Future of Web Audio ##

When Chris Wilson, co-editor of the Web Audio API specification for
the W3C and developer evangelist for audio technologies at Google, was
in London recently he and [Sam Dutton](https://twitter.com/sw12)
invited me into the Google offices to have a chat about recent
developments and the future of Web Audio.

## Farfisa Fast 3 Organ Simulator ##

A very convincing simulation of the Farfisa Fast 3 vintage analogue
organ, complete with selectable tones and fast/slow vibrato. You can
connect a MIDI keyboard too, and study the code on github.

## Generative Jazz with Web Audio ##

Don Veca emailed me to share the outputs of his Web Audio-powered
generative jazz engine. The algorithm is based on "groove templates"
and pattern generators and exposes a simple UI to control the
parameters of the generation. At the moment we only have this
intriguing recording to listen to, but I'm excited to see what Don
decides to do with his application and whether we'll be able to get
our hands on it!

## Web MIDI wrapper library ##

Using the Web MIDI API, especially beyond the basics, requires some
knowledge of the MIDI spec and some fairly low-level
programming. While having full support for the spec is exactly what
the Web Platform needs, working with it can be a bit
intimidating. This library from Jean-Philippe Côté abstracts some of
this complexity away from you providing a simpler API to test for MIDI
capability, send and receive note messages and work with controller
events.

## The Art of Arrangement for Dynamic Music Systems in Games ##

A three-part article from composer Winifred Phillips on arranging
music for computer games with particular emphasis on her work for the
LittleBigPlanet series. I found it very interesting to learn about the
considerations of composers when working with an atmosphere that is in
constant flux due to the actions of the player of the game.

## TR-808 Cowbell and Hi-Hat recreation with Web Audio ##

Two great articles from Ed Ball and Joe Sullivan respectively on how
they recreated the TR-808's cowbell and hi-hat sounds by studying the
circuit diagrams and processing schematics and then re-creating the
signal path in Web Audio. Previously, I worked on recreations of the
bass-drum and snare sound from the 808 - someone should really put all
of this together!

## 808: The Movie ##

And in other 808 news, I'm very excited about this upcoming
documentary about the classic drum machine and its influence on modern
music. Featuring legendary producers and musicians such as Afrika
Bambaataa, The Root's ?uestlove and er, Phil Collins, it looks set to
be an vintage synth geek's dream!
