## Looping ##

One of the first things to try if you're learning the Web Audio API is
to load short samples and and loop them. It's an easy way to explore
the power of sample-accurate scheduling, and gives you a platform to
try out some more advanced effects.  Daniel Gagan has put together
this looping demo, with accompanying blog post - there's a lot to
learn by looking at the code.

## Web MIDI synthesiser ##

Chris Wilson, the editor of the Web MIDI specification, has proposed
some additions to the spec.  He's added a example of how to build a
simple MIDI synthesiser which shows how the Web MIDI and Web Audio
specifications work together. It's early days for adoption of the API,
but the demo should work in Chrome Canary.

## Custom-shaped Online Noise Machines ##

If you work in a noisy office, but find music too distracting, try
these randomly generated noise sources. Dr. St√©phane Pigeon uses the
Web Audio API where available to create and modify ambient noise. The
code is unminified and well-explained, and shows how to process loops
using a variety of Web Audio node types.

## Building a Synthesizer with the Web Audio API ##

The folks at Treehouse have written a tutorial on building a
theremin-style synth. It's a nice example of hooking up Web Audio to a
user interface.  I tried the demo on my android phone using Google
Chrome, and I was surprised how well it worked with the touch
interface. We might see some exciting audio applications coming to
mobile soon!
