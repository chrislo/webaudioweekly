## Typedrummer ##

Kyle Stetz creator of the [lissajous](http://lissajousjs.com) live
coding environment has built this quirky drum machine which converts
text into beats. Use `-` or `,` to insert pauses, and `()` for
triplets.

## Listen to Wikipedia edits ##

Listen to a real time "sonification" of edits to Wikipedia. Bells are
additions to Wikipedia while strings are subtractions. Green circles
represent anonymous edits to the site, while white circles are edits
from registered users. I was also surprised by the number of purple
circles, which are edits from bots.

## Web Audio API Developer Tools for Chrome ##

Following in the footsteps of the excellent
[Firefox Web Audio Editor](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/06/introducing-the-web-audio-editor-in-firefox-developer-tools/)
comes this promising Chrome extension from Jaume Sanchez. It visualises
Web Audio node graphs, and allows you to change their parameters.

## Web Audio Slack Channel ##

I've been enjoying the discussion in the new Web Audio Slack
channel. It's a community of developers interested in audio on the
web, and is a great place to find out if there is a Web Audio meet up
planned near you.

## Scrolling Through Sound ##

At the second London Web Audio meet up, I was particularly impressed by
[Ehsan Ziya](http://www.zya.cc/)'s demo of his "scrolling through
sound" prototype. Ehsan considered how people typically interact with
applications, and has experimented with mapping the ubiquitous scroll
gesture to navigate through sound. Ehsan uses granular synthesis
techniques to map the background audio to the speed and direction of
the scroll, while reaching particular points in the page triggers
audio events.

## Web MIDI API available in Chrome 43 Beta ##

The Web MIDI API is now available without setting any special flags in
Chrome 43 Beta, which should mean we'll see it in the stable Chrome
very soon. With the Firefox implementation
[well under way](https://github.com/qdot/gecko-dev/tree/836897-webmidi)
and this petition to the
[Microsoft Edge developers](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-microsoft-edge-developer/suggestions/6508429-web-midi-api)
having reached nearly 400 votes, this could be a great year for
bringing MIDI to the web.

## The Audio Processing Dog House ##

Although aimed at iOS developers, this article from Jack Schaedler
(author of the wonderful DSP primer
[Circles, Sines and Signals](https://jackschaedler.github.io/circles-sines-signals/index.html))
has a lot to offer any audio developer. It takes us through the
building of a simple monophonic pitch-detection algorithm and explains,
with interactive diagrams, all of the necessary theory to understand
how it works.
