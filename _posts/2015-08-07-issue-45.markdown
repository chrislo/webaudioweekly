## Introduction to Web Audio with Stuart Memo ##

In this free 11-part video course from 'tuts+' Stuart Memo introduces
you to the Web Audio API and shows you how to add some simple sounds
to a web site. Stuart is a fun and engaging teacher, and learning Web
Audio lends itself to the video format - being able to see the code
and hear the sounds it creates at the same time is very useful.

## Game of Reich ##

Ben Taylor has cleverly combined Conway's Game of Life with the
minimalist aesthetic of Steve Reich. The music is derived from the
positions of tiles on the grid, but the sound can be filtered using
the envelope at the bottom. Simple, effective and surprisingly fun to
play with. I'd have liked a bigger grid so I could try and build a
[gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_(cellular_automaton))!

## Web Audio Recorder Node ##

This library provides a custom 'node' to allow you to record the
output of a web audio node graph, and schedule the recording at a
precise time in the future.

## Machines learn to play Tabla ##

In this blog post Gaurav Trivedi explains how to train recurrent
neural networks to learn the rhythms of the Tabla. The demonstrations
sound very convincing to my untrained ear, and I also enjoyed learning
about the informal notation system used to describe Tabla rhythms.

## W3C Music Notation Community Group ##

The W3C have recently formed a community group to examine the
feasibility of standardising music document formats for the web. Joe
Berkovitz, who is heading up the group, has also shared his thoughts
on why this is an important step forward for musicians who work on the
web.

## 3D audio visualisations with three.js ##

The 'dancing cube' in this demo is created using the WebGL wrapper
library three.js. The positions of the cubes are synced to the
frequency and tempo of the music performed using a Web Audio
`Analyser` node.

## Synthesisers ##

No issue of Web Audio Weekly would be complete without some
synthesiser-related links. This week, I enjoyed reading a long-form
article from Rhodri Marsden on the recent re-invention of hackable
synthesisers and how they relate to the modular synths of old.

The 'Syntorial' is an innovative approach to learning how to play and
program synths which combines a tutorial series of lessons with a
built-in soft synth. This might work really well as a Web Audio
application too.
