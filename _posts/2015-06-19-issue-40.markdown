## Loop Drop ##

Loop Drop, the fantastic looping performance system from Matt McKegg
that we covered in issue 37, now has its own website
[http://loopjs.com/](http://loopjs.com/). Matt has turned the code
into a stand-alone application which wraps his web application. He's
created some compelling demos and documentation, and alongside the
open-source code for developers there's also a paid-for,
easy-to-install version for musicians. There's even a
[soundcloud site](https://soundcloud.com/destroy-with-science/sets/destroy-with-science)
with examples of music created using the application.

## Fields: An exploration into the use of mobile devices as a medium for sound diffusion ##

Tim Shaw and co-authors have written a paper on their collaborative
sound diffusion performance *Fields*. In Fields, the smartphones held
by audience members act as a diffuse array of loudspeakers,
distributing the sound throughout the performance space. The paper has
some details on the motivation for the piece, the use of Web Audio,
some ideas on using motion sensors and gestures as instruments, and
background references on this emerging type of performance.

## wavesurfer.js ##

Wavesurfer is a customisable waveform visualisation widget with a
range of useful plugins to support region highlighting, split-channel
waveforms and more. It analyses the audio data to create the waveform
using Web Audio.

If you're looking for a server-side solution to allow multiple levels
of zoom resolution for longer audio files, there's also the
[peaks.js](https://github.com/bbcrd/peaks.js/tree/master) library.

## LabSound ##

LabSound is a Web Audio implementation that has been extracted from
the WebKit source code. It's designed as a stand-alone C++11 library
which can be used as a general-purpose sound engine. The
[wiki](https://github.com/meshula/LabSound/wiki) has a number of
examples of JavaScript Web Audio code ported to use the LabSound
library.

## WebAssembly: A new binary format for the web ##

Google, Microsoft, Mozilla and WebKit announced WebAssembly this
week. It's designed to provide a cross-browser compile target for code
that can run inside the browsers JavaScript engines. As someone who
learnt how to do web development back in the 90's using "view source"
I'm not sure how I feel about this development, but from the point of
view of high-performance DSP code used for musical applications it may
be an early vision of the future.

## Kadenze: Free online music courses ##

Kadenze is a new MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) platform
specialising in courses in the arts and creative technologies. In
their initial lineup of courses there looks to be some of particular
interest to audio developers including a Stanford course on
[synthesis and signal processing](https://kadenze.com/courses/an-introduction-to-physics-based-digital-audio-synthesis-and-signal-processing/info),
Lonce Wyse's
[Web coding for artists](https://kadenze.com/courses/js450-web-coding-for-artists/info)
course which has a Web Audio component, and a course on
[loops and variation in music](https://kadenze.com/courses/loop-repetition-and-variation-in-music/info)
from Cork University. The courses are free to take, but there are
subscription-based plans if you want to have coursework graded, and a
payment option for university credit.
