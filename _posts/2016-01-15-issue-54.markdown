## Canopy - a Web Audio scratch pad ##

Google's Hongchan Choi has developed this incredibly useful Web Audio
scratch pad. As well as providing a place to write your code, there's
also a handy zoom-able waveform visualisation to help debug any issues
in the audio output. The tool comes with a built in audio node graph
visualisation too, accessible using the "eye" icon, and a way to load
a Github gist directly in to the editor. I can see myself making heavy
use of this tool for my next project.

## Modulator: A Web Audio modular synthesiser ##

I love this modular synthesiser from Luis Crespo. The editing
interface is polished and powerful, with each individual module having
its own set of parameters that can be individually tweaked. There's a
good selection of presets to help you learn how to use the synth, and
a simple but effective way to save and load your own patches. The
multi-octave arpeggiator is particularly fun.

## Matt McKegg: I play the JavaScript ##

Matt McKegg, author of the Web Audio live performance and composition
tool [Loop Drop](http://loopjs.com/) gave this talk at JSConf.Asia
2015 on the inspirations for his software, and how he uses the Web
MIDI API to connect it to a wide range of controllers. Matt is really
pushing the state-of-the-art with his software and his
performances. One of the key take-aways from this talk is how the
ubiquity of the web platform is allowing musicians to build their own
tools that feel like the kind of instruments they've always wanted to
play.

## Monophonic Ringtone Synthesiser ##

Do you miss the ring tone from your very first mobile phone? If so,
this synth is for you. Hook up your MIDI keyboard and annoy your
office mates or fellow commuters like it's 1997!

## Little Drummer Toy ##

Sorry for bringing this to you too late for the festive season, but
this project from Ableton will fun at any time of the year!

## 5:1 Web Audio demo from Dolby ##

This small code snippet from Dolby Laboratories points at some
interesting experiments they are running with Web Audio. If you're
looking for an example of how to work with multi-channel output
devices this code is a straight-forward starting point.

## Making an interactive Web Audio slide-deck ##

Sole Penadés's amazing WebGL and Web Audio-powered
[slide deck](http://soledadpenades.com/files/t/2015_howa/) was one of
my favourite Web Audio projects last year. In this video Sole explains
how the slides were put together and how to use some of the tricks in
your own projects.

## Proper loudness metering on the web with EBU R128 ##

> I hate squashed and over-compressed music. It leads to ear-fatigue
> quickly, is often distorted and sounds dull and low-fi compared to
> dynamic music.
>
> That’s why I created something called LoudEv, an open-source online
> loudness evaluator, which is compliant to EBU R128.
>
> LoudEv uses the Web Audio API, Web Workers and the great wavesurfer.js
> by katspaugh to do its thing: Analyzing an audio file (on the
> client-side, no server upload necessary) and then creating a
> two-dimensional loudness map of the song as well as a dynamics map.

## Modern Approaches: Producers reveal their sound philosophies ##

The Red Bull Music Academy are releasing a series of interesting
interviews with top music producers on how they use effects, including
compression and reverb, in their music. The techniques are illustrated
with embedded soundcloud examples. A useful resource.

## Exploring the Web Audio API with D3 ##

This article from Scott Logic's William Ferguson explains how to
combine the Web Audio API with the D3.js visualisation framework to
analyse and visualise sound.

## Dear Architects: Sound Matters ##

An interactive article from the New York Times that uses
spatialised audio to illustrate the importance of sound, or the lack
of it, in our built environment.
