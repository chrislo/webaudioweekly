## Building the Madeon Adventure Machine ##

The critically-acclaimed companion website for Madeon's debut album
Adventure (which we covered back in
[issue 35](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw/2015/03/23/web-audio-weekly-35.html))
was made by the creative studio
[wemakeawesomesh.it](http://wemakeawesomesh.it/). In these two blog
posts Syd Lawrence takes us behind the scenes of the audio aspects of
their creation covering formats for gapless playback and how they
synced the audio with the visuals. Keep an eye out for the 3rd
instalment showing how they added support for the Novation Launchpad
MIDI controller.

## Serial communication using Web Audio ##

A great write-up of a very clever hack using the Web Audio API to
transmit UART serial data to an Arduino at 9600 baud. Their hack
reminded me of the
[MicIO.js](http://colinbookman.com/2014/03/23/micio/) project from
[issue 13](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw/2014/04/03/web-audio-weekly-13.html),
in that both authors talk about using audio channels of data as a way
to avoid expensive or proprietary means of communication between
browsers and smartphones.

## Tone.js version 5 released ##

Yotam Mann has released the latest version of his excellent Tone.js
library. Tone.js wraps up many of the features of the Web Audio API in
interfaces that make it much easier to build applications. For example
rather than worrying about the details of synchronising sounds at a
specific tempo, Tone.js allows you to express timing in more musical
terms such as BPM (beats per minute). New features in version 5 include

- A new drum synth with kick and tom sounds
- AM and FM synth modules
- Reverse playback for the sampler module
- Updated documentation and examples.

## Web Audio Meetup in Philadelphia ##

Joining Berlin, London and New York, Philadelphia now has its own Web
Audio meetup. If you can get to Philadelphia on July 19th you should.

## MIDI file rendering in the browser ##

Wild Web Midi is a wavetable software synthesiser capable of playing
MIDI files directly in the browser. It can render the MIDI file to an
audio file, or playback in realtime (using the Web Audio API) and is
based on the [freepats](http://freepats.zenvoid.org/) software synth
instrument collection.

## Solarbeat ##

Solarbeat, from White Vinyl design studios, generates ambient music
using the orbital periodicity of the planets in our solar system. By
playing with the parameters of the generator, such as the tempo and
musical scales, you can generate a wide range of sounds. It's a remake
of an earlier Flash-based application, ported to use the canvas and
Web Audio APIs (I found Firefox would get redirected to the Flash
version, so had to use Chrome to hear the new Web Audio-powered
version).

## Building a Realtime Music Sync Collaboration App With PubNub ##

PubNub is a hosted message storage and synchronisation solution for
building collaborative applications. In this article they show how it
can be used to power the backend of a collaborative Web Audio app.

## Learning: Think DSP ##

I often get asked if I can recommend books to help learn digital
signal processing. I wanted to call out Think DSP by Allen B. Downey
(author of the excellent Think X series of books for O'Reilly). He
teaches the concepts of signal processing from a programmers
perspective, approaching topics such as spectral analysis, filtering,
and the Fourier Transform from a practical, algorithmic point of view
rather than a mathematical one. The exercises he develops are written
using Python, but Downey doesn't assume a large amount of familiarity
with the language.

## How I'd Redesign Sheet Music ##

A beautifully illustrated set of ideas from Alex Couch on the design
of notation for music, and the piano in particular.
