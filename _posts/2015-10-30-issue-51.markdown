## Hands on Web Audio ##

Sole Penad√©s, Web Audio expert at Mozilla, has created this fantastic
slide deck to introduce the Web Audio API and demonstrate its
capabilities. Frustrated with having to leave a presentation to run
demos, Sole has embedded all of the examples directly in the
slides. 'Slides' doesn't really do this justice - it's more of an
interactive audio application and a great overview of the capabilities
of the Web Audio API and modern browsers in general.

## Looplabs ##

Looplabs is a collaborative music-making application built with the
Web Audio API that allows you to listen to tracks made by other
musicians, and then remix or create entirely new songs yourself in the
built-in multitrack "studio". The studio itself is a
slickly-implemented interface reminiscent of traditional desktop music
software, with individual tracks, effect busses and a library of
samples and loops. The integrated chat feature allows you to
collaborate with other people on your composition in real time.

## Web Audio JS Developer at Looplabs ##
### Sponsored post ###

Looplabs are reimagining what music can and should be with a
collaborative, cloud based music production platform. They're looking
for developers who are familiar with the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs
and have experience developing full stack JS applications.

## pizzicato.js ##

`pizzicato.js` is a Web Audio API wrapper from Alejandro Mantecon
Guillen. It's designed to abstract away some of the boilerplate code
required when working with the API directly, allowing the user to
specify audio graphs and combinations of effects at a higher level:


    var sawtoothWave = new Pizzicato.Sound({
        wave: { type: 'sawtooth' }
    });

    var delay = new Pizzicato.Effects.Delay();
    sawtoothWave.addEffect(delay);

## Blend4Web adds Web Audio support ##

Blend4Web is a development platform for interactive 3D applications on
the web. With the latest version developer can exploit some of the
features of the Web Audio API without having to program with it
directly. The new audio features allow directional sound sources to be
added to 3D models within the Blend4Web environment, which compile
down to Web Audio node graphs for deployment to the browser.

## New node chaining API now in Firefox Nightly ##

A small but significant change to the Web Audio API specification
means that calling `connect()` on a Node returns the destination. This
means node graphs can be created by method chaining:

    var ctx = new AudioContext();
    var gain = context.createGain();
    var delay = context.createDelay();

    gain.connect(delay).connect(ctx.destination)


The change has already been implemented in FireFox nightly.

## Pitch shift the audio from any HTML5 video ##

Foxdog studios have taken Chris Wilson's
[pitch shift demo](https://github.com/cwilso/Audio-Input-Effects) and
packages it up as a Google Chrome extension allowing you to alter the
pitch of any HTML5 video source, for example those found on YouTube.

## Trent Reznor: Archetype of a Synthesizer ##

I'm not a big Nine Inch Nails fan, but I did enjoy this YouTube video
from Moog Music where Trent Reznor talks about his musical history and
his relationship with synthesizers. The way he speaks about the quirks
and character of his favourite synths is a refreshing antidote to the
usual narrative that electronic instruments are dry and clinical.
