## Tone.js ##

Tone.js is a very well thought out wrapper library for the Web Audio
API. It's targeted at two groups of users - those who want to build
musical applications, and those familiar with traditional graph-based
environments such as Pure Data or Max/MSP. For the former, Tone.js
offers a robust, powerful sequencer library and some built in
synthesisers with sensible presets. For the latter, it offers a
comprehensive set of building blocks for performing signal processing
tasks. Using the native nodes provided by the Web Audio API, the
author, [Yotam Mann](http://yotammann.info/), has created wrappers
that allow standard arithmetic operations (addition, modulo,
multiplication), logic operations and signal routing. All of this has
been achieved without relying on ScriptProcesserNodes so they can take
advantage of the low-latency native audio generation. Tone.js looks
like a very useful library at an ideal level of abstraction for any
Web Audio project.

## True, A Web Audio Music Video ##

Brightly are an indie/electronic band who have been recording,
performing and releasing music for several years. They also feature
Charlie Gleason who has considerable programming talent! Their new
video uses the Web Audio API to synchronise the music to the visuals,
and is really very beautiful to look at and listen to.

## Web Audio Hackdays ##

There were two Web Audio-themed hackdays this month. Web
Music Hackathon #3 was held in Tokyo, Japan and almost at the same
time Web Audio-hackers convened for a special session at
[jsfest.berlin](http://jsfest.berlin/). I'm hoping to cover this
events in a bit more detail in the next newsletter, but for now here's
a quick taster:

- The winning hack from Tokyo was
  [this face-tracking drum machine thing](https://himakan.github.io/facetracking-effector/).
- Eiji Kitamura has written up a [full report of the event](http://blog.agektmr.com/2014/09/event-report-web-music-hackathon-3.html) too.
- Over in Berlin, organiser
  [Jan Monschke](https://twitter.com/thedeftone) pointed me at Jaume
  Sanchez Elias's hack
  [which combines d3.js with Web Audio](http://www.clicktorelease.com/tmp/wa-hook/)
  to flexible interfaces.
- [Soledad Penad√©s](http://soledadpenades.com/) produced a great
  "intro to Web Audio"
  [slide deck](http://soledadpenades.com/files/t/berlin-webaudio-hackday-2014/)
  for attendees of the Berlin Hackday.

## Leon Theremin - CIA Nemesis ##

A recent Freedom of Information Act request to the CIA, resulted in
the
[release of many back issues](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/09/10-declassified-articles-cia-intelligence-journal)
of the US intelligence organisation's in-house magazine /Studies in
Intelligence/. Among the articles was this cracker on Leon Theremin,
inventor of the eponymous instrument, and his role as a soviet spy.
