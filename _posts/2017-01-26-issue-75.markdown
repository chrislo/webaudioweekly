## Mubert: algorithmically generated music

Mubert creates an endless playlist of listenable electronic music in
various styles including ambient, trap, deep house and trance. Being
entirely computer generated the music is naturally somewhat
generic-sounding but impressively orchestrated and listenable. I can
see this application working great as interruption-blocking background
music, or as part of a royalty-free soundtrack.

## Charanga seek full-time web audio developer

[Charanga](http://charanga.com/) is recruiting a full-time web audio

Building web-audio applications to support curriculum, instrumental and
electronic music-teaching in the classroom, your initial projects will be a
secondary school composition and vocal recording application, and a
music-theory training application.

## Fastidious Envelope Generator

It's surprisingly difficult to create classic
attack-decay-sustain-release (ADSR) envelopes using parameter
automation in the Web Audio API. If you don't take care to
consistently ramp gain to zero then pops and clicks can occur;
scheduling all of the parameter changes needed for an envelope at an
arbitrary point in the future is also a complex book-keeping
exercise. This library abstracts away these implementation details and
provides you instead with a higher-level interface for declaring
parameter envelopes. A welcome addition to the Web Audio toolkit.

## Clubber - audio reactive visualizations

Clubber is a JavaScript library that takes the hard work out of
creating synced visualisations of audio. Connect the clubber node to
another audio node in your Web Audio application and you can
periodically request a variety of measures of the sound - for example
the average energy of all active notes or a power-weighted average
MIDI index. The github page for the library links to some fantastic
demos.

## Book: JavaScript for Sound Artists

This new book from William Turner and Steve Leonard looks
interesting. It hasn't been published yet, and I haven't read a copy,
but the table of contents promises a full-introduction to programming
in JavaScript for non-programming artists followed by a tour of the
features of the Web Audo API.

## DrumIt - create your own drum beats

A fun grid-sequencer drum machine application with a variety of sample
acoustic and electronic drum kits. You can save the patterns you come
up with and export them as WAV files.

## Tonehack

Tonehack is an exploration in timbre - how the tonal qualities of a
sound can vary so much even when the pitch stays the same. It puts you
in control of each harmonic of the sound by allowing you to draw the
volume and pitch envelopes and how they vary with time. A large
variety of presets helps to illustrate the theory.

## 99% Invisible: The Evolution of Architectural Acoustics

The history of the study of reverberation covered beautifully in this
20min podcast episode and show notes from the 99% Invisible team.
