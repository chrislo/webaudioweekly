## AudioKeys: a QWERTY keyboard for Web Audio projects ##

AudioKeys, a library from Kyle Stetz, allows you to map the keys on a
standard QWERTY keyboard to musical notes. If you've built an
instrument with the Web Audio API this allows anyone with a standard
keyboard to play it. The library provides shortcuts for shifting the
octave range of the keyboard and for setting the velocity of notes. It
also solves some tricky problems such as what to do with notes when
the user switches browser focus to another tab. It's event-based too,
so it's easy to decouple from the rest of your code, or to combine
with other input sources such as MIDI instruments.

## Learning and tutorials ##

### The Web Audio API: What is it? ###

To accompany the Tuts+
[video series on Web Audio](http://code.tutsplus.com/courses/add-sound-to-your-site-with-web-audio)
from Stuart Memo, they're also publishing a series of blog posts,
starting with this brief introduction to the API.

### Web Audio Primer ###

Andy Sylvester has written a series of tutorials on various aspects of
the Web Audio API which use the `Theresa's Sound World` framework also
created by Stuart Memo. The lessons are focussed on synthesis and
building a simple instrument.

## Web Audio Meet-up in Lausanne, Switzerland ##

Cruncher, a web design agency in Lausanne, are hosting the first Swiss
Web Audio meet-up on the 24th August 2015 at their offices. Contact
Cruncher or @stephband for more information.

## soundio: a standard way of creating music sequence data in JSON ##

[Last week](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw/2015/08/07/web-audio-weekly-45.html)
we heard about the work of the W3C's Music Notation Community Group
and the effort to find a standard for exchanging sheet-music-like documents.

Stephen Band pointed me at another interesting proposal in this
space - a light-weight JSON format for exchanging note sequence
information that is independent of the way that notation is presented
visually. I can see an exchange format like this being very useful as
an intermediate serialisation format for music sequencer applications,
for example.

## This is Not a Machine Learning ##

An interesting essay and sound art piece that uses the Web Audio API
to generate increasingly complex variations of an initial piece. The
audio is synchronised to a visualisation built with `three.js`, and
the source code is available to dive into in more depth.

## Making a game: audio ##

A great article from the developers of the `Blend4Web` game engine on
how to create and record audio effects for a game. They also discuss
how to synchronise those effects with the actions of the characters in
the game. The authors confess that they are amateurs in this aspect of
game design, but I think that makes the article a more interesting
read as they really get into the practical details.
