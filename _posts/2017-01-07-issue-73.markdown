## Radio Garden ##

Explore the radio stations of the world with this application. As you
spin the globe random radio stations from each location are played. I
found it surprisingly addictive to explore the similarities in music
played across the world but the huge differences in speech and local
radio. The Creative Applications write up gives some more of the
technical detail behind the project.

## WeTracker ##

WeTracker is a faithful reconstruction of a 90's style Tracker
application (and in particular is modelled after
FastTracker2). Trackers were heavily used in the demoscene and could
create compact, multi-sampled compositions for games. WeTracker has
support for loading MOD files, so you can try playing some [songs from
the
[ModLand archive](http://modland.com/pub/modules/Fasttracker%202/). If
you're interested in Tracker music Paul Gregory the author of
WeTracker is looking for collaborators
so [take a look at the repo](https://github.com/pgregory/wetracker).

## Probe: AudioTool Online Sample Editor ##

AudioTool have long provided
an
[online, collaborative music making platform](https://www.audiotool.com/) based
on Flash. They have started work to migrate the tool to the web
platform using the Web Audio API but for such a complicated
application this is a huge amount of work. Recently they announced a
stand-alone tool called Probe which acts as a fully-featured sample
editor. The waveform zooming, selection and editing in particular is
very fast and intuitive.

## Chant by Waterplea ##

## Hebdomad ##

Hebdomad is a Xenharmonic Musical Instrument - that is an instrument
designed to allow you to explore the spaces between the standard 12
notes used in a traditional western music octave. The application has
a range of built in 7-note scales to try.

## 8-bit Music Theory ##

The 8-bit Theory YouTube channel explores classic video game music to
work out how and why it sounds the way it does.
