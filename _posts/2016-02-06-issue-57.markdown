## mmorph ##

mmorph is described as an "online audio-visual workflow
experiment". Think part music-video, part instrument, part game. It is
a collaboration between Massive Music, Owen Hindley and Reactify Music
and of interest to Web Audio-folks it is the first public facing
project to use [Enzien Audio's Pure Data](https://enzienaudio.com/)
compiler - a toolchain that can now generate Web Audio code alongside
portable C code for the x86 and ARM platforms. The app is Chrome-only,
but it is nevertheless a great example of the current state-of-art of
Web Audio applications.

## Machine Learning for Musicians and Artists ##

This free online course from Goldsmiths University released on the
Kadenze platform introduces techniques from machine learning in the
context of musical applications.

> Have you ever wanted to build a new musical instrument that responded
> to your gestures by making sound? Or create live visuals to accompany
> a dancer? Or create an interactive art installation that reacts to the
> movements or actions of an audience? If so, take this course!

## Meyda 3.0.0 ##

Also hailing originally from Goldsmiths the real-time audio feature
extraction toolkit Meyda has reached its 3.0.0 milestone. Meyda works
offline using nodejs and in real time using the Web Audio API. It
supports many different feature extraction algorithms including
zero-crossing rate and energy for time-domain signals, and power,
skewness and spread in the frequency domain.

## Yamaha Soundmondo: Web MIDI patch sharing app ##

Yamaha's new Soundmondo application allows owners of Yamaha's
synthesisers to download and share patches with other
musicians. Thanks to the Web MIDI API (Chrome only) this is a simple
as connecting your synth and visiting the Soundmondo website. The
promise of the Web MIDI API was that it would allow instrument
manufacturers to do away with clunky desktop software in favour of a
more modern, web-based experience and it's really exciting to see a
major player take a step in that direction.

## Web Audio Conference 2016: early bird registration ##

Early-bird registration for the second Web Audio conference to be held
at Georgia Tech, ends on February 15th.

## Chrome 48 released - with Web Audio method chaining ##

Chrome 48 is out, and among the changes is support for a slightly
sweeter method chaining syntax in the Web Audio API. Calls to the
`connect` method now returns the passed in node or parameter, so we
can build Web Audio graphs in a terser style:

    ctx = new AudioContext
    osc = ctx.createOscillator()
    g1 = ctx.createGain()
    g2 = ctx.createGain()

    osc.connect(g1).connect(g2)

## Starting the Audio Context on user action (iOS) ##

If you've developed a Web Audio application and tested it on iOS, you
might have hit this issue

> On iOS, the Web Audio API requires sounds to be triggered from an
> explicit user action, such as a tap. Calling noteOn() from an onload
> event will not play sound.

This small library from Yotam Mann listens for the first explicit user
action, and starts the audio context in the background by connecting a
silent oscillator node. A handy hack that should save some head-scratching.

## Fourier Visualisations ##

Fourier Analysis tells us that any waveform can be described as the
addition of simple sine waves of different frequency and phase. This
interactive visualisation from Ben Grawi shows how sawtooth, square
and triangle waves can be approximated by summing together many sine
waves. You can see how the approximation improves as more sine waves
are added, see the coefficients of the Fourier series and hear the
result.

## Virtual Oscilloscope ##

A nice, simple oscilloscope application that cleverly uses the
computer's soundcard as an input source (using `getUserMedia` on
Chrome and Firefox). Freezing the input and adjusting the x and y
scales lets you take measurements from the signal just like on a real,
hardware oscilloscope.

## Trump Donald ##

It's taken a long time, but I think we've finally found Web Audio's
"killer app".
