## Audiograph ##

Matt DesLauriers Audiograph is a "visual exploration of Pilotpriest's
2016 album, TRANS". It uses WebGL and Web Audio to create a
visualization for each of the album's tracks, and also makes use of
Dolby's Digital Plus where supported. Matt has also made the code available on Github.

## genish.js ##

The Web Audio API is designed around the idea of "per block"
sampling. If you connect an `Oscillator` node to the destination, for
example, the underlying audio engine is actually creating a block of
128 sample at a time to the output. In practice this limitation is not
too significant, and it vastly improves the efficiency of the
implementation.

However for some operations, if you want to create a delay node with a
delay time shorter than 128 samples, for example, the block-passing
technique is not suitable. In these cases, `genish.js` is a library
that can help. It processes samples through the audio graph one sample
at a time.

It does this by generating a callback function that can be passed to a
`ScriptProcessor` node - an approach that currently has its own
limitations as the documentation explains.

This is an exciting project, one that will appeal to people coming to
Web Audio from a PD or MAX/MSP background, and it looks set to see
dramatic efficiency boosts with the arrival of the `ScriptProcessor`
replacement `AudioWorklet`.

## Tiny 808 ##

Joe Sullivan has been working on some accurate synthesised recreations
of the original Roland TR-808 drum sounds. You can play with the whole
set using his "Tiny 808" synth, or install them as individual `npm`
packages from his github page.

## Chrome Music Lab: Making Kandinski ##

Kandinsky is a musical toy from Chrome Music Labs that lets you draw
shapes and see them come alive as funny, music-making creatures. In
this blog post the developers go into detail about the WebGL and Web
Audio techniques they used to create it.

## Scribble Audio ##

Turn your scribbles into tunes with this new Web Audio tool from Kyle
Stetz. I love the "record wav file" button which immediately creates a
recording of your composition for download.

## Pixel Synth ##

Turn images - ones you've drawn or uploaded - into glitchy
compositions.
