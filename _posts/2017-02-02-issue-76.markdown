## Finding Love ##

> Finding Love is a fully interactive, Virtual Reality story that
> transforms emotions into art. Moving through five distinct chapters,
> you experience the journey purely through visuals and sound.

For the full virtual-reality experience you'll need an Oculus Rift,
HTC Vive or Google Cardboard device, but the experience is still
pretty mesmerising when viewed in a regular browser. The case study
gives all the technical details.

## Beadz ##

Beadz is an experimental, polymetric drum machine. Along with the
familiar grid-style interface for laying out loops, you can also set a
probability that each sound will be played, creating endlessly
shifting rhythms from simple patterns.

## Terry Riley's "In C" ##

In this wonderful article, Tero Parviainen's explores Terry Riley's
"In C" composition. "In C" provides each musician in an ensemble with
a series of simple patterns and leaves the musicians to choose how
many times they play each pattern and when to move on to the
next. Tero explains how such simple rules, combined with the
musicians' intuition and sensitivity leads to an endless number of
interpretations of the piece. Beautiful interactive examples in the
article let you hear these variations for yourself.
