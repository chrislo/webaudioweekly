## Acid Machine 2 ##

Acid Machine is an integrated music production environment featuring a
sequencer hooked up to some classic-sounding emulations of TB-303
synths and a drum machine with a full set of retro-sounding
samples. If you've ever
used
[Rebirth from Propellerhead](https://www.propellerheads.se/rebirth)
this arrangement will be very familiar to you. The app feels solid and
intuitive (especially if you have familiarity with the
machines/software it is emulating). An interesting feature is the
availability of a paid-for [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
powered desktop version which can load Rebirth `.RBS` files. I also
love the implementation of a MIDI "learn" mode to map controller signals
to the knobs and buttons of the virtual tools.... now I just need
to
[make a nice MIDI controller](http://djtechtools.com/2015/08/25/how-to-make-your-own-diy-midi-controller/) to
play with it!

## Web Audio Designer - a GUI for building Web Audio node graphs ##

Web Audio Designer allows you to specify the nodes, connections and
parameters of a Web Audio graph using a GUI. You can preview what a
graph will sound like using the play buttons on each node, and even
provide some basic controller elements to test interactions and
parameter choices. An incredibly useful feature is the ability to
export the graph you have built as JavaScript ready to edit and
incorporate into your application. If I could have anything else it
would be an "oscilloscope" node to help visually debug parts of the
graph.

## Comet ##

Comet is a web synthesiser with an experimental interface. It features
a double oscillator with 5 waveform, detune and gain mix each,
filters, customizable effects all wrapped up in a colourful animated
interface.

## Audio User Experience explorations from Codrops ##

Codrops is a web design and development blog. Musical Interactions
explores how mouse gestures and other user interactions can be mapped
to audio. There's a lot of different ideas here and the code is
available on Github if something inspires you.

## W3C Workshop on Web & Virtual Reality ##

Virtual reality is a rapidly emerging technology that is being
explored both on and off the web platform. On the web the challenge of
positioning audio in the same virtual space as the visual is being
tackled using Web Audio - notably through
Google's [Omnitone](http://googlechrome.github.io/omnitone/#home)
project. This report from a recent W3C workshop gives a broad overview
of the state of the art of VR on the web.

## Don't Just Mix ##

Another inspiring Chrome Experiment - this time from Chi Zeng who has
built an impressive multi-channel digital audio workstation (DAW). All
the features you'd expect are here - including multi-channel recording
and playback, an effects bus, solo and muting of channels and
non-linear editing of the audio.

## webmusic-icons ##

A set of public domain icons that you can use in your audio
projects. Featuring a variety of synths, microphones, instruments and
connectors.

## A Brief Survey of Sound Art ##

A fantastic overview of the history of sound art from the avant garde
ambient of the early 1900's to the experiments of contemporary artists
today.
