## Chrome Music Lab ##

For Music in Our Schools Month a team at Google we wanted to help make
learning about music a more accessible to everyone by using technology
that’s open to everyone: the web. The experiments they have created
cover many aspects central to music making - rhythm, tone and melody,
all powered using the Web Audio API. To the team's credit they've also
brought these experiments to Firefox as well as their own browser,
which shows how far the standardisation effort has come.

## Eye Conductor Brings MIDI To People With Disabilities ##

Eye Conductor from Andreas Refsgaard uses affordable eye tracking
software and a cheap webcam to translate facial gestures and eye
movements to MIDI messages that can then be used to control
instruments and musical applications. Andreas carried out user
research in schools and housing communities to develop technology that
would allow people with severe motor disabilities to make music.

## Plan8 Throwerwall ##

Use your phone to pick up members of Plan8's team and throw them
screaming at a wall. A silly game with a very clever execution using
both mobile and desktop browsers, augmented with Web Audio sounds.

## Glitch: a noisy fusion of math and music ##

> Bytebeat music has no conventional musical notation — there is no
> notes or chords or even instruments. All you have is a mathematical
> expression that is evaluated for each time frame to generate the next
> amplitude value of the sound wave.

## Clara Rockmore’s 105th Birthday ##

Clara Rockmore was a famous player of Léon Theremin's eponymous
instrument. In this Google doodle you first take a series of lessons
to learn how to play the instrument, and then, as Clara, perform your
own piece to a rapturous audience. I love the "settings" cog which
allows you to select the scale and tone of the instrument.

## jsSID ##

jsSID is a ground-up emulator for the
[Commodore 64 SID chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_SID). This
legendary programmable synthesiser has taken on a life of its own long
after the computers in which it first appeared have faded into
obsolescence. With 3 oscillators, filters, a ring modulator and envelopes
it was a surprisingly powerful synth in a compact package - and with
jsSID Mihaly Horvath has brought the experience of programming for it
to the web platform. You'll have to dig into the source code to make
sense of it, but Mihaly has some samples of what it sounds like on the
website.

## WebGL and Web Audio = Fireworks ##

Choose a song (or just stick with the ZZ Top default!) from this
jukebox and enjoy the synchronised fireworks display. Best enjoyed in
"presentation mode".
