## 1st Web Audio Conference submission deadline ##

IRCAM, the famous Parisian centre for electronic music research, are
hosting a Web Audio conference on the 26th-27th January 2015. The
deadline for submissions is on the 10th October. The conference
organiser Samuel Goldszmidt has contacted me to share the new
guidelines for submission which clarify how to submit your talk. If
you've built a demo or library using the Web Audio API, and can take
some time to explain how and why you built it, I'd encourage you to
submit. And I'll see you in Paris in January!

## Oscilloscope  ##

When debugging Web Audio applications it's often very helpful to be
able to visualise the sound generated at particular points in the
graph of nodes you have created. This code snippet from
[Kevin Cennis](https://twitter.com/kevincennis) provides an
"oscilloscope" that does just that. It has a useful sensitivity slider
to help lock the refresh frequency of the scope to the frequency of
sound you're creating - this freezes the waveform to make it easier to
see what's going on.

## Web Audio synthesizer by Luke Teaford ##

[Luke Teaford](http://luketeaford.com/) has built this 2-oscillator
synthesizer using the Web Audio API. It has some really fun presets,
and enough flexibility to create your own sounds. It would be great to
see this working with the Web MIDI API so that the synth could be
controlled from an external MIDI controller.

## Web Audio Mock ##

If you're building a large Web Audio application, you might have
wondered how to write automated tests for your code to make it easier
and safer to refactor, for example. Relying on the "real" Web Audio
API in your tests is difficult as it restricts how quickly they can
run, and requires a test environment which supports the API. This
library from [mohayonao](http://the.mohayonao.com/) provides a "mock"
Web Audio API implementation which you can rely on in place of the
real thing.

## NASA Scientists listen to data ##

An interesting article from NASA on how their scientists turn the
output from data collected by the sensors on satellites into audible
frequencies. By playing them back very quickly, and training their
ears to make sense of the sounds, they are able to review and find
interesting signals in the data much more quickly than they could do
if they relied on plots and other visualisations.

## Bob Moog Foundation pays tribute to Leon Theremin ##

> In celebration of Leon Theremin's birthday, the Bob Moog Foundation
> pays tribute to Bob's "virtual mentor", a titan pioneer of
> electronic music technology. Michelle Moog-Koussa, Executive
> Director of the Bob Moog Foundation, reads from Bob's foreword to
> Albert Glinsky's "Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage".
