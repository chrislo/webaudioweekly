## Jerusalem ##

Jerusalem is a digital artwork from Paul Pfeiffer and Brian Fulkerson
that revisits the most famous occasion in the sporting history of
England, the 1966 World Cup final. Creative technologist
[Nat Buckley](http://ntlk.net/) used the Web Audio API to mix the
different background sound effects together, and used a variety of
different fallbacks to support a wider range of browsers. The clear,
unobfuscated source code makes for interesting reading.

## How to Build a Supersaw Synthesizer ##

An interesting blog post which recreates the "super saw" synth sound
made famous by the JP-8000 synth from Roland. Zach Denton recreates
the sound using a series of detuned sawtooth oscillators, and shows
how to hook this up to a simple visual interface using CoffeeScript
and CSS.

## Tuna Knobs ##

Terrible name, interesting idea: a set of physical rotary controls
that you can use with ipad music applications. It looks like the
kickstarter project has been funded, so the Dutch design company
responsible, Tweetonig, are accepting pre-orders. The Wired article
gives some background.
