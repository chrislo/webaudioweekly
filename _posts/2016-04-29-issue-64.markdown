## Jory Prum: 1975-2016 ##

It is with great sadness that I mark the recent passing of Jory
Prum. Jory was best-known for his sound engineering work at LucasArts
where he created the sound tracks for well-loved games such as Sam &
Max, Monkey Island and Grim Fandango. Jory was also an enthusiastic
early adopter of Web Audio, contributing his experience with game
audio to the early designs of the Web Audio API and collecting
interesting links and articles on his
[HTML5 Audio](http://www.html5audio.org/) blog. I was lucky to spend
time with Jory through this shared interest and his warmth, generosity
and enthusiasm will be missed by all who knew him.

## Novation use Web MIDI to bring Circuit to the web ##

[Circuit](https://uk.novationmusic.com/circuit/circuit) is a
MIDI-controller, synth, sequencer and drum machine combined into a
playable hardware interface. To allow more control over the device,
Novation have built a Web MIDI-powered application that allows you to
upload new samples as well as edit and share patches. It's exciting to
see that this isn't a side-project for Novation. They've promoted the
app heavily on their homepage showing the confidence they have in the
stability and utility of Web MIDI.

## mod-synth.io ##

mod-synth.io is a really slick synthesiser application which allows
you to build patches in a "modular" style by connecting oscillators,
filters and other building blocks together. The UI is intuitive with a
handy tutorial to help you get started. The synth has MIDI support so
you can play using a real controller instead of the default QWERTY
mapping, and you can save patches by logging in. One of the
best-executed web synthesisers I've seen.

## Cracked ##

Way back in
[issue 24](http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/waw/2014/08/16/web-audio-weekly-24.html)
we learned about Bill Orcutt's minimal DSL for chaining audio graphs -
"I dropped my phone the screen cracked". Bill has now packaged the
library up as a standalone OS X application, complete with MIDI
interface, called Cracked. It combines a live-coding interface with
MIDI inputs that, says Bill, "feels like a software equivalent to one
of the cheap Silvertone or Kay guitars I use – something primitive and
stripped down, where the inner workings are exposed and easily
modifiable, and the music feels like it's being made by you rather
than by the program.”

Wire magazine carry more details of the backstory, and a demo video.

## Mira ##

From Active Studio and Plan8 comes Mira, a "meditative experience for
web, mobile, physical installation and VR all using the same
JavaScript codebase". Play with the application in the first link and
read more about the technical details of this ambition project over on
medium.

## Envelope Generator ##

`envelope-generator` is a library from Joe Sullivan to help you build
envelopes for your Web Audio applications. An envelope is a series of
parameter changes that you might apply, for example, to the volume of
a sound to synthesise the rise and fall of a real instrument. The
library lets you easily specify what are known as ADSR
(attack-decay-sustain-release) envelopes without worrying about the
fiddly parameter scheduling you'd have to do when working directly
with the Web Audio API.

## `midi-ports`: easy access to MIDI hardware ##

A handy library to make it easier to work with attached MIDI devices,
`midi-ports` provides inputID, outputID, name, and manufacturer of all
attached devices as JS objects.

## MIDI Logger - debugger console for MIDI ##

Attach a MIDI device and quickly see which messages are being sent as
you use it. Great for debugging Web MIDI applications or writing new
device interfaces.

## A curated list about Audio Visualisation ##

A huge list of resources and links about visualising audio both on the
web and elsewhere.

## WKT Audio: Web Audio API file loader ##

WKT Audio is a library which allows you to load a sound and a
predefined part of a Web Audio node graph at the same time. For
example, the following code loads two samples, and attaches them both
to a gain node.

    var resources = {
      snare: "sounds/snare.mp3",
      drum: "sounds/drum_loop.mp3",
      nodes: function nodeGraph(sound) {
        var gain = audioContext.createGain();
        gain.gain.value = 0.5;
        sound.connect(gain);
        gain.connect(audioContext.destination);
      }
    }

    var sound = wktAudioBatch(resources);
    sound.snare.play();
