## Tinysynth

Tinysynth is a complete implementation of the General MIDI instrument
sets (including all those familiar presets from 90s keyboards: "slap
bass", "new age pad", "gunshot" and friends). The really impressive
thing here is that all of the instruments are synthesised using
Oscillator nodes - not a single PCM sample has to be loaded. The demo
page allows you to play some example tracks using multiple
instruments. If you're looking for a light-weight set of instruments
to synthesise music, look no further.

## Charanga seek full-time web audio developer

[Charanga](http://charanga.com/) is recruiting a full-time web audio
javascript developer to work in its Brighton, UK, seaside office (no remote
work, sorry!). Salary up to £38.5K depending on experience. Closing date
for [applications](http://charanga.com/jobs) is March 5th, 2017.

They operate over 100 websites, a couple of iOS/Android apps, a PC,
Mac and Linux desktop app and a suite of music education apps, all
built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Charanga is used in more than 6500 schools in the UK, by tens of
thousands of teachers and pupils, and we are currently expanding
globally.

Building web-audio applications to support curriculum, instrumental
and electronic music-teaching in the classroom, your initial projects
will be a secondary school composition and vocal recording
application, and a music-theory training application.

## Stopping an Oscillator at Cycle Completion

A frequent problem developers face when first working with the Web
Audio API is how to avoid the nasty click that occurs when you stop an
oscillator. In this article Sebastian Zimmer takes a novel approach -
why not calculate the time when the oscillator waveform naturally
becomes silent ("crosses zero") and stop it then? Along the way you'll
learn about basic calculations of waveforms in JS and how to start and
stop Oscillators.

## JSAmbisonics

Ambisonics is a technique for positioning sounds within a virtual
environment. With the rise of Virtual Reality the technology is again
coming into prominance. In this paper researchers from IRCAM in Paris
and Aalto University in Finland explain what Ambisonics is and how it
can be used in Web Audio applications using the JSAmbisonics library
they developed and open-sourced as part of their research.

## Web Audio Boilerplate

Sebastien Piquemal has put together this useful collection of code
that smooths over the differences between browsers' implementations of
the Web Audio API - making it easier to build Web Audio applications
that work across different browsers, OS's and platforms.

## Free sounds from the European Space Agency

The European Space Agency has recently made a huge number of images
and sounds available in the public domain. If your next project needs
a sound from another planet have a listen through their SoundCloud
channel for inspiration.

## Noisli

Noisli is an browser based background noise simulator with a
difference - this one comes with a distraction-free text editor so you
can block out the world and concentrate on your writing without
leaving your browser tab.

## Can you identify a formula for chart success?

For the BBC4 documentary "The Secret Science of Pop" BBC R&D helped
the production team analyse music to determine whether there were
characteristics of timbre, tempo, pitch and rhythm that could
accurately predict chart success. See whether they succeeded by
watching tonight's documentary and read the details on their blog.

## Deconstructing gameboy soundtracks: The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening

The Nintendo Gameboy had very restrictive audio hardware: 4 channels
of audio, 2 of which could only contain square waves, one that could
only make noise and the fourth that had a programmable
waveform. Despite these restrictions composers were able to come up
with some very sophisticated soundtracks for their games. In this
article Jason M. Yu deconstructs the soundtrack of "The Legend of
Zelda: Link's Awakening" showing how by using strong motifs, clever
variations and a lot of creativity a classic game soundtrack was
created.
