## Recreating the sound of night vision googles ##

The popular video game Splinter Cell allows the player to wear a pair
of night vision goggles. When they power up they make a distinctive
sound. In this article Ed Ball recreates the sound using the Web Audio
API. What's interesting about this is not the recreation of the sound
itself per-se, but rather the approach Ed takes to first analysing the
sound to recreate in the frequency and time-domain and then showing
how to use that analysis to inform the Web Audio code you need to
write. This technique, known as
[resynthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis#Additive_analysis.2Fresynthesis)
has many useful applications.

## Sampulator ##

The sampulator is a sample-based instrument with a loop sequencer -
ideal for making short grooves and beats. It comes pre-loaded with a
sample pack and features several pre-made tunes to give you
inspiration. An interesting innovation is the shop where you can
purchase new samples.

## Elements of Dance Music ##

Paul Adenot is the lead developer of the Web Audio API in
Firefox. He's also a talented computer musician. In this video from
JSConf.Asia 2015 he combines the two talents to make a techno track
from scratch using the synthesis capabilities of the Web Audio
API. Paul concentrates on the timbre of the music rather than the
melody or rhythm in the talk - which means a lot of synthesis
techniques, filtering and effects.  There's a lot to learn from this
video and the code on github.

## Creating Virtual MIDI Ports On OSX for Web MIDI ##

If you a keen to play with the Web MIDI API, or want to try out some
Web MIDI-powered applications but don't have access to a MIDI
controller, this article shows you how to use virtual MIDI ports and
devices on OSX. You'll end up with a virtual on-screen "keyboard" that
emits the correct MIDI messages.

## Audio glitches with a terminal ##

If you're looking for some weird and wonderful sounds, look no further
than the innards of your own laptop. Using some command-line utilities
you can generate noises from the contents of databases and log files,
or from the chatter on your local network.
