## Djenerator: A metal breakdown generator ##

Djenerator is an algorithmic generator for metal riffs. It comes with
presets that generate riffs in the style of Tesseract, Sworn In, Thall
and others. Clicking the "settings" link opens a huge range of options
to tweak the generator, and your favourite presets can be
saved. Although I'm not a huge fan of metal, this app is a
seriously-impressive combination of algorithmic generation and web
audio, and I still spent lots of time playing with it. The code is on github too.

## DX7 Emulator ##

A full-featured implementation of the Yamaha DX-7 synthesiser with
support for MIDI input. This app also comes bundled with the original
patches featured in the DX-7 including the classic "E.Piano 1". The
DX-7 was notoriously hard to program, replacing the familiar knobs and
sliders of analogue synths with a series of nested, digital menus. I
find in most cases that replicating knobs and sliders in web
applications makes virtual instruments harder to use. Here, however,
replacing the nested menus of the original with a series of controls
for each "operator" makes it much easier to experiment with than the
original.

## 108 ##

108 is a minimal beat machine featuring 5 classic samples that can be
arranged on a 16 step loop running 108 bpm. The "grid" in this case is
a circle, with an indicator for the current time rotating around its
perimeter. It's a simple way to start experimenting with drum
patterns, it'd be nice to see the ability to switch between different
loops but overall I love the simplicity of the approach. The animated
page title is a nice touch too!

## Space Bumps ##

Space Bumps is an audio visual app for generating experimental
arpeggios and ambient landscapes. The parameters of its synth engine
are controlled by dragging "stars" around the constellation, and the
resulting soundscape can be saved and shared on social networks.

## Third International Conference on Technologies for Music Notation and Representation ##

The call for papers for this conference, to be held in A Coru√±a, Spain
on 24th-26th May 2007, is now open. The organisers are looking for
submissions in many areas some of which are particularly interesting
to readers of this newsletter:

1. Notation in electronic and electroacoustic music
2. Live coding
3. Innovative computer applications for music notation
4. Sound visualization

## StepSequencer ##

Adam Beck has just started playing with the Web Audio API and has
built a fun step sequencer for creating short, looping melodies. It
uses a single-oscillator synth, and as Adam asked for some feedback
I'd suggest trying to extend the synth engine to include an additional
oscillator, and some control over the envelope of each note. Take a
look at Adam's app and see if you have any further suggestions - the
code is on github.

## VisualizerMicro ##

VisualizerMicro is a micro JavaScript library to make it much easier
to extract waveform and spectral data from audio. A great time saver
if you're working on a audio visualisation project.

## Electronic Ladyland ##

Electronic Ladyland is a free compilation of 55 tracks from 35
pioneering women in electronic music mixed together into a seamless 45
minutes. The compilation took 18 months to put together and features
over half-a-century of electronic music experimentation.

And if you're a fan of Daphne Oram, who features on this compilation,
you might also be interested in the recent project to rebuild her Mini
Oramics machine.
