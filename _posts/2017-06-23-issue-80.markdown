## Get Started Making Music with Ableton

This wonderful, interactive series of lessons helps you learn the
basics of music composition and production. There's an emphasis on
electronic music forms (this comes after all from the folks behind the
ubiquitous Ableton Live music production software) but plenty to learn
for anyone who is curious about how music is made.

The Web Audio-powered examples in each section are beautifully
executed and elevate what would be a textbook into something
altogether richer and more effective.

## mpe.js

MIDI Polyphonic Expression (MPE) is an extension of the standard MIDI
1.0 specification which allows individual notes within a chord to have
independent pitch bend applied to them. The standard is implemented
in, for example,
ROLI's
[Seaboard controller keyboard](https://roli.com/products/seaboard). Oscar
Dub has written the `mpe.js` library to allow developers to access
these capabilities using Web MIDI. The library is well documented with
examples and a quick video gives a good overview of the concept.

## Hacking Soundcloud

Attila Haraszti's post explains how to automate interactions with the
Soundcloud service to progressively alter an uploaded track based on
user interactions. This sounds like the kind of thing that an API
would be ideal for - but in lieu of that, because Soundcloud is a web
application it is possible to add some user-interface tweaks that are
a bit too niche for the company to include themselves and in doing so
allow a digital artist to express themselves in the way they want to.

## Google Doodle for Oskar Fischinger’s 117th Birthday

This recent Google Doodle uses Web Audio to celebrate the birthday of
Oskar Wilhelm Fischinger (22 June 1900 – 31 January 1967) a pioneer of
animation, motion graphics and musical artwork. The doodle is a
4-voice step sequencer with beautiful animations that pulse in time
with your composition.

## Jam Together

Jam Together is an online service from Kevin Decock that allows
musicians to collaborate together with each other in private
"rooms". The app works with a midi controller, but also with the
regular computer keyboard. You can currently play with a piano, a
synth, and a drum pad and "more instruments are definitely in the
pipeline" according to Kevin. Jam Together are looking

## WebbyJam

Japanese freelance developer Hiroyuki Takakura has created this
music-making application which combines a chord generator, rhythm box
and sequencer together in an application which puts the emphasis on
fun, simple music making. I was a little confused by the acronym DTM
at first - apparently this is how computer music is referred to in
Japan (it stands
for
[Desk Top Music / デスクトップミュージック](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%9F%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF)).

## Choirplayer needs your help

Choirplayer is a multitrack music player from Peter Woods which is
specifically designed for choirs. It features timed lyrics for each
part and the ability to mute and solo tracks - very useful features
when you are learning or rehearsing a part. The application is still
in development and Peter is looking for some help to develop it
further. If you can help hit reply and I'll put you in touch with
Peter.

## This cybernetic synth contains a brain grown from the inventor’s cells

> The core of this synthesizer was grown in a lab from actual living
> cells sliced right out of its creator. Skin cells are transformed
> into stem cells which then form a neural network – one that exists
> not in code, but in actual living tissue.
