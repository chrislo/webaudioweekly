## Making a boombap beat with dilla and the Web Audio API ##

A brilliant tutorial from Adam Renklint on creating a hip hop beat
from simple samples, the Web Audio API and a handful of effects. The
tutorial uses Adam's Dilla library which takes its inspiration from
the classic Akai MPC60 sequencer by allowing you to schedule beats in
96th beat increments. I love the simple notation language for
scheduling the beats and the way Adam uses it to create the groove.

## Madeon's Adventure Machine ##

The technique of combining simple loops into more complicated tracks
is taken to a wonderful extreme in this interactive promotional piece
for [Madeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeon)'s debut album
Adventure. You can create and share your own remix of a Madeon song
using this slick
app. [Apparently](https://plus.google.com/+ChrisWilson/posts/YmEyYL9rLAT),
if you have a Novation Launchpad MIDI controller, you can also trigger
the loops using that. If you'd like to send me one to test that
theory, please get in touch!

## Web MIDI spec update ##

In other Web MIDI news, the W3C's Audio Working Group has just
published a revised working draft of
[the Web MIDI API](http://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/4502). There's
been some changes to how device states are monitored, and the changes
coincide with Google's Chrome team announcing their
[intent to ship](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/blink-dev/oPyFORhQ9jQ)
which means Web Midi will be available without setting an `about:flag`
in Chrome soon.

## Web Audio Charity Hack Day in Scotland ##

A Web Audio hack day is being run as part of ScotlandJS on Wednesday
the 6th of May. All proceeds will be given to charity and attendees
will have the opportunity to work with mentors to learn more about Web
Audio. I'll be at the conference, so if you do make it along please
come and say hello!

## Vuvuzela Denoiser ##

Hate Vuvuzelas? Love watching replays of 2010 world cup matches in
your browser? This site is for you! Vincent Choqueuse uses the Web
Audio API to explain lots of different signal processing concepts,
including this creative use of a 5 band notch filter to help remove
the sound of that infamous instrument.

## 303 simulator ##

A comprehensive simulation of a Roland TB-303, the machine responsible
for countless acid-house tracks. The simulator allows two machines to
play at the same time, and also has a drum sequencer with TR-808 style
samples.

## Hand-drawn schematics from the Bob Moog archive ##

The Bob Moog foundation have released a new collection of schematics
of early Moog synths and prototypes, some hand-drawn by Bob Moog
himself. I particularly like the front panel layout for the
Synthesizer 1P.
