Here is a collection of my favourite Web Audio and Web MIDI projects,
tutorials and libraries from 2016.

## Applications ##

- [Chrome Music Lab](https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/): A
  collection of playful explorations of music theory designed for
  children.
- [Polyrhythm](http://www.petervandernoord.nl/polyrhythm/): I loved
  this interactive exploration of polyrythmic rhythms. Mesmerising but
  also educational.
- [Circuit Components from Novation](https://components.novationmusic.com/):
  Novation were one of the major music technology manufacturers to
  embrace Web MIDI this year with Circuit Components, their web-based
  tool to enhance their Circuit synthesiser.
- [Gregorian Voices](http://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/gregorianChoirGenerator.php):
  Stéphane Pigeon has built some beautiful background noise generators
  this year, perfect for relaxing or drowning out the sounds of a
  noisy office. I loved this Gregorian Chant generator.
- [scribble.audio](http://scribble.audio/): Kyle Stetz blends
  innovative audio ideas with beautiful interfaces, such as in
  Scribble, his keyboard-cum-sketchpad.
- [loopjs](http://loopjs.com/): Loop Drop is a stand-alone
  music making application from Matt McKegg built with Web Audio and
  Electron. Matt has performed at numerous conferences and festivals
  this year using this software.
- [Djenerator: A metal breakdown generator](http://djen.co/):
  algorithmic composition meets heavy metal in this
  seriously-impressive mashup.
- [Music Eclipticalis By Brian Foo](http://eclipticalis.com/):
  Generate music from star maps in the style of John Cage's Atlas
  Eclipticalis.

## Tools & Libraries ##

- [Canopy](http://hoch.github.io/canopy/): Google Web Audio developer
  Hongchan Choi's Canopy tool is my go-to for debugging, evaluating
  and playing with Web Audio code.
- [Omnitone: Spatial audio on the web](https://google-opensource.blogspot.co.uk/2016/07/omnitone-spatial-audio-on-web.html):
  The growing interest in VR on the web requires powerful tools for
  spatial audio. Omnitone delivers these in the form of a library for
  binaural sound.

## Tutorials ##

- [JavaScript Systems Music: Learning Web Audio by Recreating The Works of Steve Reich and Brian Eno](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html):
  A wonderful article from Tero Parviainen on recreating the sounds
  and composition techniques of Steve Reich and Brian Eno using Web
  Audio.
- [Avoiding Clicks](https://alemangui.github.io/blog/2015/12/26/ramp-to-value.html):
  Probably the most frequently asked technical question I encounter is
  "how do I avoid clicks and popping sounds when working with Web
  Audio". This article tells you all you need to know.
- [Beat Detection Using JavaScript and the Web Audio API](http://joesul.li/van/beat-detection-using-web-audio/):
  A practical and well-written tutorial from Joe Sullivan that takes
  you beyond the basics of Web Audio by showing you how to detect
  beats in music.

  This in-depth tutorial from Peer to Peer screencasts featuring
  Mozilla's Soledad Penadés is a great introduction to the Web Audio
  API.

## Talks ##

- [Paul Adenot: Elements of Dance Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ww0jTafmd_w):
  A virtuoso talk from Paul Adenot, lead developer of the Web Audio
  implementation at Mozilla. Paul builds a techno song from scratch,
  in real time, using the Web Audio API.
- [Tools For Thought](https://acko.net/files/gltalks/toolsforthought/):
  A wonderful animated explanation of mathematical transformations,
  including the Fourier Transform, visualised and turned into sound
  using WebGL and Web Audio.
- [Unexpected Musical Instruments](https://vimeo.com/170005228):
  Attending SudWeb was one of my highlights of the year. I had a great
  time and gave this talk on scratching, circuit bending, computer
  music and the Web Audio API.
