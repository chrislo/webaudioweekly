## Echo ##

Echo is part-game, part-composition tool. You have to solve a series
of puzzles to unlock parts of a song. When complete you can remix the
song by completing the puzzles in different ways. It's an interesting
concept and quite hard to explain, but a lot of fun to play. The
author Yotam Mann has also written a post about the technology behind
the game, which is also well worth a read.

## Patatap ##

Patatap is a web-based instrument with a very beautiful combination of
animations and sounds from Jono Brandel, of Google's Creative Lab. It
uses Web Audio's buffer sources to play the pre-loaded samples, and as
a result is very responsive to both keyboard presses on desktop and
touches on tablet and mobile.

## Bitcrushing ##

Bitcrushing is an effect achieved by intentionally lowering the
resolution of a sound, either by lowering the sample rate or by
quantising the samples to a smaller number of bits, or both. Jason
Frame's library uses a ScriptProcessorNode to achieve the effect, and
is a nice example of how to write your own custom processors in javascript.

## Beat It ##

"As Jackson couldn't fluently play any instruments, he would sing and
beatbox out how he wanted his songs to sound by himself on tape,
layering the vocals, harmonies and rhythm before having
instrumentalists come in to complete the songs."
