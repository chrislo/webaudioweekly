## W3C Audio WG meets at TPAC ##

The W3C Audio Working Group, the team responsible for developing the
Web Audio and Web MIDI specifications, met recently at the W3C plenary
meeting. Of particular interest to developers was some of the proposed
changes and features expected to be added to the Web Audio API,
including
[a simpler, reworked panner node](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/372),
support for low-latency custom nodes using
[audio workers](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/113),
[side-chain compression](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/246)
in the DynamicsCompressor node, and support for
[suspending AudioContext for battery performance](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/317)
reasons. Although these changes have been agreed, it will take a while
for them to specified and a little longer still before they start to
appear in browsers, but they should make many more things possible
when they arrive.

## Meyda - audio feature extraction library ##

If you're attempting to automatically detect the genre of a piece of
music, want to separate 'sound' from 'silence', or build a Shazam-like
music identification service, you'll need to perform feature
extraction on the audio. This library calculates many useful features
including spectral shape, loudness and MFCC using the Web Audio API.

## Headphone Surround Sound ##

The BBC recently [broadcast a play](http://rdmedia.bbc.co.uk/radio4/)
which had been recorded for 5.1 surround sound. For those listeners
who don't have such a listening setup, they provided a "headphone
surround sound" feature built using the Web Audio API. The
ConvolverNode is provided with impulse responses recorded using a
dummy head to process the sound so that it sounds like it is coming
from a particular point in space even when listened to on
headphones. Chris Pike's post on the BBC R&D blog has more details.

## Blip ##

[Blip](https://jshanley.github.io/blip/) is an expressive sampling and looping API build on top of Web Audio. Its support for random scheduling of samples allows complex-sounding compositions to be created from simple building blocks.

## Websynths ##

I enjoyed playing with this [synthesizer](http://websynths.com/)
developed by Mitch Wells. It allows micro-tuning of the individual
keys, and has a variety of interesting patches.
