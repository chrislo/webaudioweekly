[purescript-behaviors](https://github.com/paf31/purescript-behaviors) is a project to allow developers to more naturally work with time based events in the Purescript JS dialect. [purescript-audio-behaviors](https://github.com/mikesol/purescript-audio-behaviors) extends this concept to working with audio. As the author puts it "you describe the way audio should behave at a given time, and the function is sampled at regular intervals to build the audio graph".
