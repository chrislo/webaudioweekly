A very interesting interview with Jason Lim from Glasgow based synth maker Instruō. I thought this might interest readers of this newsletter because the conversation covers porting hardware synths to software (in this case the VCV platform) and gets quite in-depth on the nitty-gritty technical issues like performance, testing and modelling of analogue circuity.
