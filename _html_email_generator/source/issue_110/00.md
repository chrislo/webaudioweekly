Grooves is a new browser-based sampling drum machine from WebSynths (see their previous [microtonal synth](https://www.websynths.com/microtonal)). It features a very comprehensive polymetric 8-track sequencer with step randomisation and parameter-locking. There's a large library of one-shot samples to choose from and you can hook up a MIDI controller to record patterns using your favourite controller.
