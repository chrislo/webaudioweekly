This one takes me back - a drum/groove machine based on the Commodore 64 SID chip. Think glitchy chip-tunes but with an amazing range of available sounds. The faithful SID emulation is paired with an easy-to-use sequencer, QWERTY keyboard control and optional support for MIDI keyboards and game controllers (via the [Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API)).
