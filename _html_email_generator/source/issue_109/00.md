title: Venn 7. Symmetric 7-Venn Diagrams as a Musical Interface.
author: Nathan Ho

You're probably familar with the three overlapping circles that form
the traditional Venn diagram. It turns out to be surprisingly
complicated to create simple Venn diagrams with 7 circles. The about
page (click on the `?`) and [github
repo](https://github.com/nhthn/venn7) give a lot of fascinating
history and background about the mathematics behind these diagrams
while the app itself maps the seven circles to a diatonic scale to
create a strange but beautiful instrument.
