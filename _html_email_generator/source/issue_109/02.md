title: Castor & Pollux User Guide

This is an interactive user manual for a Eurorack synth module. These
things tend to be expensive and there's a whole cottage industry of
YouTube reviews and demos. The user guide for this module has another
way you can try-before-you-buy. It features sound demos and animated
waveshape visualisations interspersed in the documentation. Simple but
very effective.
