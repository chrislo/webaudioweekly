title: SuperCollider ported to WebAssembly
author: Hanns Holger Rutz

We've had browser ports of
[CSound](https://vlazzarini.github.io/paw/examples/index.html) and
[PureData](https://puredata.info/downloads/webpd) but this is the
first attempt I've seen to port James McCartney's venerable
[SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) synthesis engine to
the browser using Wasm. In the link above you can boot the server, and
then run SuperCollider code in the browser console. Or [watch this
video](https://diode.zone/videos/watch/81f255f4-13f3-4038-ae38-8d4de3ce2a2c)
for a demo.
