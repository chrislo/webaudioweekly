title: Woscillators - Mutable Instruments Plaits in the browser
author: Victor Saiz
---

A port of Emilie Gillet's [open-source Plaits
instrument](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack) to the
browser. Victor has converted and compiled the source code of Plaits
to Web Assembly to create this application. There's a faint, grey
loudspeaker icon next to the gain slider that will start the sound and
an LFO section to provide some modulation.
