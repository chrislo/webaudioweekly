This recreation of the classic Roland drum machine and synth
combination was released last year to coincide with the London Design
Museum's [Electronic
Music](https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/electronic-from-kraftwerk-to-the-chemical-brothers)
exhibition. Beautifully executed and easy to get lost in. And if
you're in need of some jaw-dropping inspiration try this [virtuoso
performance of another classic Roland drum machine by Jeff
Mills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eU-UsvYbIV0&feature=youtu.be).
