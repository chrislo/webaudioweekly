Thank you very much for all the positive messages last week. The world
is very strange right now but I hope this newsletter brings you a
little joy (and some bleeps and bloops).

If you'd like me to keep writing please consider [buying me a
coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis). Baby not sleep. So
tired.
