I hope you enjoy this week's newsletter. I've included a couple of Web Audio apps and tutorials and also some pointers for getting involved with the future development of the Web Audio and WebCodec APIs.

If you enjoy this newsletter [make a small contribution](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis) to help me to keep working on it. And please forward it to a friend!
