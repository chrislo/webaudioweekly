title: Priority features for the Web Audio API
author: W3C
---

The W3C Audio Working group has some priorities for future improvements to the Web Audio API. They're looking for input from developers, so this is a great opportunity to shape the future of the API. Of particular interest at the moment are proposals to:

- [Expose AudioBuffer to DedicatedWorker](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/111)
- [Preemptively determine audio thread overload](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/40)
- [Allow user-selectable render quantum size](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/13)
- [Detect when a user is using headphones](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api-v2/issues/89)

If those or any of the `priority-1` issues are of particular importance to you, or you have relevant knowledge that may help, use the Github issues to start a conversation.
