author: Tom Hazledine

A wonderful interactive Web Audio API tutorial that covers more than its title suggests. As well as demonstrating how to create delay effects, the article also shows how to synthesise notes, quantise them to musical scales, and design their sound. Each snippet of code is accompanied by an interactive widget and spectrum plot.
