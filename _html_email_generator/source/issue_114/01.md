title: WebCodecs proposal
author: W3C
---

The WebCodecs specification is a proposal to allow encoded video and audio to be decoded in the browser. From an audio point of view the aim is to have a Web Audio-interoperable API that uses separate threads to decode the audio and can therefore handle multiple simultaneous decodes. The authors are looking for feedback from the developer community, so take a look at the proposed spec and make any suggestions [in the issue tracker](https://github.com/WICG/web-codecs/issues).
