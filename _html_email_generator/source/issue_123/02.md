author: Neil McCallion

A great introduction to synthesis with the Web Audio API from this years [NIDevConf](https://www.nidevconf.com/). The 30 minute talk is accompanied by a [codepen](https://codepen.io/njmcode/pen/rNebvPe) which is a great example of how to integrate Web Audio into a React application. (via Abe Tusk).
