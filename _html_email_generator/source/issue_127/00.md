NoiseCraft is a browser-based visual programming language for sound synthesis and music. Maxime has recently restarted work on the project and has [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/maximecb/noisecraft). It takes inspiration from Max/MSP and PureData but has a minimalistic UI designed to be as simple as possible to facilitate learning. Find out more in [Maxime's blog post](https://pointersgonewild.com/2021/12/05/noisecraft-a-browser-based-visual-programming-language-for-sound-music/), or try an example such as [these relaxing ocean sounds](https://noisecraft.app/50).
