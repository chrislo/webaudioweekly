Notysing is a music education application that allows you to learn music by singing. The team wrote to tell me that they use Web Audio heavily:

> We have created a custom JSON music format that can be used for music notation as well as audio sequencing, and we have created a scheduler, a sample player with its own sample instrument format. It can be run in browser and is built with cordova for both iOS and Android.
