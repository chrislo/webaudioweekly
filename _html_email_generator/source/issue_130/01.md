Released [in 2019](https://www.webaudioweekly.com/102), Ableton's [Learning Synths](https://learningsynths.ableton.com/) project remains one of the most polished and compelling uses of Web Audio in an educational context. While we probably won't hear about what they're working on next until it arrives, it's exiting to see that Learning Synths continues to receive updates. It now features recording (up to 60s of audio for you to drop into your [favourite Web Audio groovebox](https://tahti.studio/) for example), export to Ableton Live and the customary dark mode. A good excuse to revist, or to experience for the first time.
