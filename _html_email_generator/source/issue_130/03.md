The twelve-note musical scale we are familar with from a piano keyboard is a compromise between the "natural" tuning of vibrating strings and the ability to play in any key. Brian Ginsburg's synth (inspired by the [work of William Sethares](https://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/ttss.html)) allows you to explore what happens when you break away from that convention:

> Coincident Spectra is an additive synthesizer that generates sounds from 16 sine wave 'partials' that can be switched between harmonics and spectra. Coincident spectra reduce sensory dissonance and beating between the timbre and tuning, rendering chords more in tune.
