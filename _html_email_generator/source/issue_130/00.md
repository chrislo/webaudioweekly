Typebeat is a hybrid live performance and live coding instrument that uses the computer keyboard as an instrument. The author Kofi explains:

> Typebeat turns keystrokes into music production commands. It's a fast, hands-on workflow for sampling, synthesizing, and sequencing sound.

Combining a classy two-tone design with some innovative features, it's really fun to play. Kofi digs into the background and inspiration for Typebeat in the [accompanying blog post](https://kofi.sexy/blog/typebeat-v010).
