Open-Unmix uses a trained deep neural network to perform source separation on mixed audio files. It can separate a recording into vocals, drums and bass tracks, for example. I noticed recently that the reference implementation includes a [version ported to JavaScript](https://sigsep.github.io/open-unmix/js.html) using tenserflow.js which can be used to test the models on shorter files before commiting to getting the full pipeline working.
