Max Alyokhin has created a generative composition called "Concerto for public transport orchestra in four movements". The 4 pieces use real time public transport data feeds to create musical pieces and accompanying visualisations. Max says

> Approximately after 22:00 Moscow time the amount of traffic begins to decline dramatically, making the sound less dynamic and more sparse, so the night time is not recommended for listening.

But as I listen now at around that time I'm finding the [occasional microtonal plucks](https://orchestra.stranno.su/microtonal_composition_in_quarter_tones/) very peaceful.
