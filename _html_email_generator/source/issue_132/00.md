The Web Audio Conference happened in person (and online) earlier this month. The [conference programme](https://wac2022.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/node/27) has links to the accepted papers, and there's some unedited recordings of the whole conference on [Michel Buffa's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vZKRYdSHckcngkRMVyZRQ/videos) YouTube channel. Hongchan Choi's pre-recorded [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dS7Eq0DkRZc) "Life after: looking ahead to a new decade" on the next 10 years of Web Audio is thought provoking if you can spare 30 minutes.
