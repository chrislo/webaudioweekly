ChipTone is an in-browser tool for designing sounds to be used in games. The author, Tom Vian, has ported the original Flash version to the web using Web Audio. It features a great 8-bit sounding effects chain, arpeggiator and an FM synth engine. The randomize and mutate buttons make it easy to generate a huge range of different sounds quickly.
