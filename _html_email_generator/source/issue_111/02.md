author: Soul Project
---

The SOUL project recently announced the release of version 1 of the SOUL language. SOUL is domain-specific language for writing audio processing (DSP) code, and a runtime for running that code on hardware. In edition SOUL code can be compiled to C++ or WASM. The latter can run in the browser in the context of Web Audio applications. The [browser playground, soul.dev](https://soul.dev/lab/) lets you get a feel for the language by writing and running it in the browser.
