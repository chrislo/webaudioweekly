Patchcab is a [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com/) inspired modular synthesiser in the browser built on top of  [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/). It looks great and the [source code](https://github.com/spectrome/patchcab/tree/main/modules) is a really interesting example of how to structure a complicated Web Audio application using the [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) framework.
