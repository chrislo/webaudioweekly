This issue of the newsletter is uniquely yours thanks to NFTs on the Blockchain (and the electricity consumption of a medium sized country). No it's not. It's distributed using the Internet and deliberately [free for everyone to read](https://www.webaudioweekly.com/). Support the writers, artists and musicians you love directly. You can [support me here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis).
