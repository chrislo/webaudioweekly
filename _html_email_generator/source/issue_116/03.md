title: Darkwave - Guitar Synthesiser
author: Stewart Smith

Darkwave is a browser-based guitar synthesiser. It analyses audio input (ideally from a guitar plugged into an audio interface, but it works with microphone input too) in realtime and turns it into synth sounds. A neat feture is that all of the parameters are serialised into the URL, so it's easy to bookmark or share your favourite patches.
