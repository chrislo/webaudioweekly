title: Beatport DJ - in-browser DJing
author: Peter Kirn

Create Digital Music have this first-look at Beatport's new in-browser DJing tool. The tool is currently in closed beta, but this article gives a good overview of its features. It certainly looks like one of the more high-profile and advanced audio applications to appear on the web platform and if it lives up to its promise of being stable enough for live performance it will be a major achievement. I'd love to learn more about how it was built - if you were involved in making it and would like to chat [get in touch](mailto: chris@webaudioweekly.com).
