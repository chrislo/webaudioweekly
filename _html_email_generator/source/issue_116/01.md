A series of touch simulation pieces written for a hand-built device that uses electrical nerve stimulation to simulate touch. Described by the maker as "closest thing to touch available in quarantine during The 2020 Novel Coronavirus Pandemic". There's a companion WebMIDI application that allows users to create their own sequences and send them to their loved ones.
