title: WebAudioXML - Web Audio apps with JavaScript
author: Hans Lindetorp
---

WebAudioXML makes it possible to write Web Audio applications without writing any JavaScript. It does this by parsing an XML document on the fly and converting it into HTML, UI code and a Web Audio node graph. There's some [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLQ9EtICrzxGrR-x6MWhTl7ci2orezvjtQ) and [demos on CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/DjaYkE). The author, Hans, is a researcher at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and has developed the tool to make it easier for others to develop interactive sound and music applications.
