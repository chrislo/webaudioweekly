With much improved support for the [AudioWorklet API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet) and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), it's increasingly more feasible to write audio code in languages other than JavaScript and compile it to run in the browser. This allows the code to be shared between the web and native platforms, for example. In this tutorial Peter Suggate gives an overview of these different technologies, how they work together and how to write audio processing code for the web in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
