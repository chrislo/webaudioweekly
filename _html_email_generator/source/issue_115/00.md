title: Modeling an analogue delay in the Web Audio API
author: Joshua Geisler
---

In this article, Joshua creates an classic analogue-style delay effect using the Web Audio API. The Web Audio `DelayNode` on its own creates a single, clean echo. But to create that vintage sound we need to introduce feedback, and something to degrade the signal as it is fed back into the delay line. Joshua also looks at modulating the delay time for some warbling, chorus effects.
