author: Collins

Design studio Collins have recently created a brand new [typographic brand](https://www.wearecollins.com/work/sf-symphony/) for the San Fransisco Symphony. The type logo is built to react to sound and music in a way that evokes the movement of sound waves, or the pulse of a graphic equaliser. The link above has a demo of the project. I enjoyed the summary in [Jeeves' twitter thread ](https://mobile.twitter.com/jeeveswilliams/status/1364346940582887428) (sent to me by [Andrew](https://andrewnicolaou.co.uk/)).
