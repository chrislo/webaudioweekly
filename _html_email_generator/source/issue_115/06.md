This application came out before Christmas, but when I showed it to my son it scared him, so I didn't get round to playing with it. I've revisited it this week, and it is joyous (although admittedly, pretty weird). If you haven't seen it and enjoy AI-powered, Web Audio-rendered opera sung by animated blobs, you're in for a treat.
