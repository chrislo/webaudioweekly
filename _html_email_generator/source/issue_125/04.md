10 Most Wanted is a syndicated radio show that can be customised for each radio station that decides to broadcast it. Rather than receiving an audio file the station instead installs an Electron app, using Web Audio, which creates the show to the station's requirements from a library of pre-recorded segments, music and bespoke content.
