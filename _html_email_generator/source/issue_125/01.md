Artist and composer Holly Herndon has released [Holly+](https://holly.plus/) a tool to allow other artists to make artwork using her voice. The tool allows you to upload an audio file and receive a download of the music sung using Holly's processed voice. The tool uses a deep neural network voice model trained on Holly's voice. The project site has detailed discussion of the motivation for the project, the implications of ownership and an experiment to share ownership using a DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organization).
