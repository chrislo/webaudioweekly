Grooveful is one of a series of practice tools for musicians being developed by Gonçalo Abreu. You can program drum patterns, schedule tempo changes or humanise the beat. To practice your own sense of tempo, schedule the beat to drop out for a number of bars and then join back in again. Take a look at [fretful.io](https://fretful.io/) to practice scales, chords and intervals.
