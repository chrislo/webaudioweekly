author: Pierre Cusa

In this explanation of waveguide synthesis, Pierre Cusa uses interactive examples to help the reader understand the theory and mathematics of pysical modelling. The examples are created using [Sporth](https://paulbatchelor.github.io/proj/sporth.html) a stack-based audio programming language that can be included in interactive notebooks using [dsp-note](https://github.com/pac-dev/dspnote).
