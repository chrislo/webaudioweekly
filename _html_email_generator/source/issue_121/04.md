I've recently discovered this podcast where Isobel (the [female DIY musician](https://www.femalediymusician.com/)) interviews other women musicians about their work, processes and route into the industry. I particularly enjoyed [a recent episode about field recording](https://www.femalediymusician.com/gtkpodcast/episode/4b644443/ep25-using-field-recordings-in-your-music).
