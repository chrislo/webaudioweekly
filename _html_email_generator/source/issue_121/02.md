title: Web Audio API is a W3C Proposed Recommendation
author: W3C
---

With a number of compatible implementations (including the Safari one above) and years of work on the specification itself, the W3C has advanced the Web Audio API to "proposed recommendation" status. This is a formal opportunity for anyone to give feedback on the API. In practice, in an age of "living standards" and browsers that auto-update, the formal publishing of the specification won't have a huge impact on end users. But it's a moment of celebration for everyone who has been involved in the project over the last 10 years. Congratulations folks!
