The new version of Safari, 14.1, now has support for Audio Worklets in the Web Audio API. The API is also available un-prefixed, as per the standard. If you need a way of testing the performance of Audio Worklets in Safari (and other browsers) Jack Schaedler's Karplus-Strong [stress tester](https://jackschaedler.github.io/karplus-stress-tester/) is very helpful.
