It's been a while since I put a newsletter together, so I have a bumper issue for you. Part of my excuse is that I've been working on [an album of ambient music](https://undershadedtrees.bandcamp.com/album/1858) that I recently released. It's available to [listen for free/pay-what-you-like](https://undershadedtrees.bandcamp.com/album/1858), let me know what you think and thank you as always for your support. I always love hearing from you, so do hit reply and say hello.
