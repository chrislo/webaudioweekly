Rust Web Audio API is a pure Rust implementation of the Web Audio API, for use in non-browser contexts. It has two goals: to provide a cross-platform audio library for command line apps, games and other applications and, via NodeJS bindings, a library that can be used both in and outside the browser using shared Web Audio code. A WAC [paper](https://zenodo.org/record/6767674) and [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1rRAMv3Ytg) explain the context and give more details.
