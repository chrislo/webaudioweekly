From creative agency Dentsu, this collection of resources for UX developers explores how to use sound in combination with UX interface elements. It includes two free-to-use collections of sounds for common interface element types such as buttons and toggles. The notes for each interface element also provide some inspiration for how you'd design your own sounds.
