Welcome to the May edition of Web Audio Weekly. There's a lot of fun and interesting projects in this months newsletter. Next month it's [Web Audio Conference](https://wac2022.i3s.univ-cotedazur.fr/) which is free to attend online. I'll be covering the conference in more detail next month, all being well. See you then!
