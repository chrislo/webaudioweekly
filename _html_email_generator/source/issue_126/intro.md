I'm going to make a renewed effort to get this newsletter out on a regular schedule in 2022, but will aim for monthly rather than weekly. If you're celebrating Christmas this week, I wish you a merry one, but whatever you're doing I hope you're safe and find some time to rest and relax. Your kind emails, links and [support](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis) have made 2021 a little brighter for me, thank you!
