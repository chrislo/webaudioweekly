Thati is a impressive browser-based groovebox. Featuring 8 sampler tracks and an Elektron-style sequencer it has some lovely UI flourishes. I like the visualisation of the tilt filter, and the ease with which you can set sample start and end points in the waveform visualisation. Very musical and absorbing to play with.
