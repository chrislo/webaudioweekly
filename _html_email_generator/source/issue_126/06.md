> I created the high-resolution die photo below by compositing over a hundred microscope photos. Around the edges, you can see the 64 bond wires attached to pads; these connect the silicon die to the chip's 64 pins... I discussed the chip as a whole in my previous DX7 article; now I will focus on the exponential circuit.
