Dittytoy is a web-based generative music environment using a minimalistic javascript API. The API syntax is loosely based on the syntax of Sonic Pi. I particularly enjoyed [this Vocoder signing Nessun Dorma](https://dittytoy.net/ditty/6f30b0885d) and this [version of Oxygene Pt. 4 by Jean-Michel Jarre](https://dittytoy.net/ditty/24373308b4).
