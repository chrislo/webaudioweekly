A wonderful explorable explanation of Sound from basic molecular physics to modes of vibration and reverberation in enclosed spaces. You may have seen some of Ciechanowski's [previous interactive essays](https://ciechanow.ski/archives/) on [mechanical watches](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/) or [cameras and lenses](https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/) and this is similarly magical.
