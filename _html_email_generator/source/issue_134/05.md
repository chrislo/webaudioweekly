In his paper [The Euclidean Algorithm Generates Traditional Musical Rhythms](http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~godfried/publications/banff.pdf) Godfried Toussaint observed that some mathematics dervived by Euclid could be used to efficiently generate music rhythms found in many of the world's musics. Torben Jansens [Observable document](https://observablehq.com/@toja/euclidean-rhythms) allows you to play with the mathematics from the paper and see how it is implement (and how it sounds!). I also came across [this post by Lawton Hall](https://www.lawtonhall.com/blog/euclidean-rhythms-pt1) which gives a visual explanation of the algorithm and lots of recorded examples of rhythms that can be generated with it.
