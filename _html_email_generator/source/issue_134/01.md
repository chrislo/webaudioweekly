title: RNBO - Run Max patches on the web and elsewhere
author: Cycling '74

RNBO is a new extension for the Max visual programming language that lets you export Max patches to run in Web Audio AudioWorklet nodes. As well as allowing you to author sound engines using a familar authoring environment, the big selling point is that the same patches can also be exported as binaries to run on the Raspberry Pi, as VST3 plugins, Max for Live devices or simply as C++ code for you to edit and embed. There's a fairly hefty price tag to get Max and RNBO, but the trial version will let you try things out.
