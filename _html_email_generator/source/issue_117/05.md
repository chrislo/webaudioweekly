To provide a more immersive experience when watching sports at home (which is all we can do at the moment, at least here in the UK), BBC R&D have been experimenting with synchronising sound on additional devices (such as phones) with the audio/video on a main device (such as a TV). [This blog post](https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/blog/2021-02-synchronised-audio-devices-sound-immersive) has more details, and a [twitter thread from one of the engineers](https://twitter.com/kristianthorin/status/1366323514819702787) discusses using Web Audio to calibrate the experience.
