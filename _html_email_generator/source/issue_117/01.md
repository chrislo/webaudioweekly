Cloud Piano combines a multi-player networked game with a piano tutor. You can join or start a room and are connected to the other players using Web RTC. The music you play (using an attached MIDI controller if you wish) can be heard by others in the room. As well as sharing your own music, you can also select a pre-recorded song, and then play along (Guitar Hero style) to receive an accuracy score.
