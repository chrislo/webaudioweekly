> SISTERS WITH TRANSISTORS is the remarkable untold story of electronic musicâ€™s female pioneers, composers who embraced machines and their liberating technologies to utterly transform how we produce and listen to music today.

I'm really excited for this documentary about "electronic music's unsung heroines". Watch out for in-person and online screenings coming up later in the year.
