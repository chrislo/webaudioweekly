> The Global Sequencer is created by Sound Designer Yuri Suzuki, as part of Hamamatsu Cityâ€™s initiative to broaden and push the boundaries of sound design. 2021 is a year still largely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, restricting the free movement of people and changing all our lives. In response to this situation, we present an interactive sequencer featuring sounds from around the world to create a sense of global connection.
