A browser based version of the classic MAX/MSP live looping, sample-cutting  environment. Unfortunately you'll need a [monome grid](https://monome.org/docs/grid/) to try this out, but the code is [available](https://github.com/taperinstruments/svemlr) if someone fancies adding a browser-based grid emulation.
