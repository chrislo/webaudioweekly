Hello! Welcome to February's newsletter. I'm enjoying the monthly schedule as it gives me plenty of things to write about, thank you to everyone who sent me something to include. And a big thanks to freelance Web Audio developer [Karim](https://github.com/infojunkie) for becoming a [member](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis) on [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis). Regular support really helps me cover the costs of sending out the newsletter.
