There's been some renewed activity in the audiojs/web-audio-api project. It's an implementation of the Web Audio API in NodeJS. A complete implementation would be very useful for creating test suites that run offline, sharing audio code between the browser and server and creating stand-alone audio applications. There's [additional background in the issues](https://github.com/audiojs/web-audio-api/issues/82).
