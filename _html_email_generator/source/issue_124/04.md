title: Profiling Web Audio apps in Chrome
author: Hongchan Choi

I missed this article, from Google Chrome's Hongchan Choi, when it was published last year. It's a in-depth look at how to profile Web Audio (in particular Audio Worklet) code in Chrome. An excellent companion to Paul Adenot's post on [profiling real-time workloads](https://blog.paul.cx/post/profiling-firefox-real-time-media-workloads/) in Firefox.
