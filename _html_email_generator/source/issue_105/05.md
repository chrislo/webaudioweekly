It's ten years since the release of the seminal "Kind of Bloop" - an 8bit chiptune tribute to Miles Davis' Kind of Blue. To celebrate the whole album is now free to download. Come for the surprisingly wonderful vibes, stay for the [liner notes](https://waxy.org/2011/06/kind_of_screwed/) where Andy Baio talks about how the album cost him $32,500 in legal fees.
