Chris has just released a new version of his indispensable `standardised-audio-context` - a library which makes the Web Audio API behave more like the spec on all platforms. This version includes support for parameter automation with `cancelAndHoldAtTime()`, the new semantics of `copy{From,To}Channel()` and makes `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` pick the right channel.
