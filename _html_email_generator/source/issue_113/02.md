title: Web Synth - Kaoss Pad style Synth
author: Joe Todd
---

A fun performance synth in the style of the classic Korg [Kaoss Pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaoss_Pad). Play notes using QWERTY keys and control effect parameters using the x-y pad. Take [a look at the code](https://github.com/joextodd/websynth) to see how it's built.
