A wonderful write-up of the building of a MIDI-controlled, mechanical slide whistle. I particularly enjoyed the rendition of [Mr. Sandman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me4gGfazUdw), but do spend some time with the rest of the article. I'm not saying this will solve all of the worlds problems, but it's got to be a part of the solution?
