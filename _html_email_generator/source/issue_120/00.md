Reactive Synth is deep modular synthesis environment in the browser. It features a large number of building block modules, as well as a useful "control surface" for controlling 2 parameters on an x-y grid. The state of every synth is stored in the URL, which makes it easy to share. You can use [one of the example patches](https://github.com/PatrickStephansen/reactive-synth#example-patches) to get started.
