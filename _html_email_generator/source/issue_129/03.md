Glicol is a computer music language and an audio DSP library written in Rust. The Web Audio angle here is that the Glicol audio engine can be compiled to Web Assembly and run in an AudioWorklet, allowing the same Glicol program to run on the web, in a VST or on a microcontroller board like the Bela.
