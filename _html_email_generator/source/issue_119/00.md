Nestup is a terse language for expressing musical rhythms. It's designed to make things that are tricky in a DAW (such as nested tuplets) straight-forward to program. The resulting rhythms can be played on the web, via a Max For Live plugin or rendered as MIDI. The [github page](https://github.com/cutelabnyc/nested-tuplets) has an amazing amount of useful documentation.
