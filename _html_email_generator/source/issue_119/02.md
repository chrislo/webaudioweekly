Jim Andrews has updated his 2000 piece Nio from Macromedia Director to use the Web Audio API. From the [project page](http://vispo.com/nio/):

> The artistic aspiration of Nio is toward a new interactive, visual and combinatory form of music: the heap. A heap is a collection of sound icons. Each icon has a sound and an animation/video. The player can hook them together so that they play either simultaneously or one after another. In other words, the player interactively layers and sequences the sounds and animations.
