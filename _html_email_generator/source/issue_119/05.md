title: Lyra - A Very Low-Bitrate Codec for Speech Compression
author: Google AI
---

Lyra is a new codec for effeciently compressing speech that relies on extracting audio features from the input speech in real time, passing these descriptors of the speech over the wire, and then reconstructing the speakers voice on the other end using a speech synthesiser. The system uses a neural network trained on a huge training set to accurately recreate the speech. In the end, I'm not listening to you, rather a synth programmed to sound like you!
