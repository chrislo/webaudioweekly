Welcome to the September edition of Web Audio Weekly. Following a little summer break for August, this month's newsletter is a bumper one. If you'd like to help me cover the costs of sending this newsletter please consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis) or [advertising](https://www.webaudioweekly.com/advertise/) in next month's newsletter. And I always love hearing from you, so do hit reply and say hello.
