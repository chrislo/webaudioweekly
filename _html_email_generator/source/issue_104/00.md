An implementation of [Jon Dattorro's reverberator](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dattorro/EffectDesignPart1.pdf) effect from 1997. Khoi has used a AudioWorklet node and implemented the effect from the paper using plain JavaScript, so this is a great example to study to learn how to implement non-trivial custom effects.
