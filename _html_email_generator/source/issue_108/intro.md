It's been a while. With a new baby arriving in April and the horrible
pandemic situation this newsletter has taken a back seat. But I'm
looking forward to working on this and other fun audio projects
in 2021. Thank you for sending in your contributions, I hope to get
round to including them all in the coming weeks.

If you'd like to help me devote more time to this newsletter please
consider [buying me a
coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrislowis).

In the meantime, stay safe and look after each other -- Chris
