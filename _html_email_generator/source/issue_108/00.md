title: Improved Web Audio API support in Safari
author: Jon Davis
---

This year has seen some significant improvements to Web Audio API
support in Safari. Support for the API has for a long time lagged
other browsers and given Apple's apparent preference for native
applications over the web the community wasn't hopeful for a
change. However Safari Technology Preview 116 not only fixes some
long-standing API compatibility issues it also enables support for the
AudioWorklet API by default. Perhaps the fact that Zoom makes use of
AudioWorklet and we're all using video conferencing software more has
tipped Apple's hand. Whatever the reason it's fantastic news for Web
Audio in general.

The [web platform

project gives a lot of detail about Safari's improved compatibility
with the spec. For now users need to wait for the next Safari update
but installing and testing the preview should give you a taste of
what's to come.
