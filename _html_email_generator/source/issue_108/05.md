author: Carl Michael von Hausswolff

> A freq_wave is a rogue wave: unpredictable, sudden, and can impact
> with tremendous force. This monster wave, curated by Carl Michael
> von Hausswolff, comprises 84 sound artists and composers
> contributing to a web-based interactive collaboration bringing
> oceanic creativity to the fore. It springs from a spontaneous act of
> solidarity, the will to connect and express ourselves.
