title: Xenpaper - A text based microtonal sequencer

Xenpaper is a terse language for sequencing music. A distinguishing feature is its great support for music outside of the Western 12 note scales. Pitches can be specified directly in Hertz, and scales can be constructed using EDO ([equal division per octave](https://en.xen.wiki/w/EDO)) notation. I like how compositions are encoded in the URL for easy sharing.
