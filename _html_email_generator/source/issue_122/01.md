Dear Diary is a type-to-music experience created by Devin Lane, Stephen Haney and Suyash Joshi. It was created in response to 2020 and how journaling and song writing helped the authors cope with a difficult year. As you type, the sentiment of your writing is analysed in real-time and fed to the Google Magenta API which then mixes between two melodies - one "happy" the other "sad". There's an [in-depth write up on the Magenta blog](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/dear-diary).
