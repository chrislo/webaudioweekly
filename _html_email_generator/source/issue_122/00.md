title: Tower of Hanoi Sonification
author: Phillip Hermans

A Web Audio sonification of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Each disk in the puzzle is mapped to its own sine oscillator, its pitch determined by which tower it is on. Phillip wonders whether "the emergent melody could help students to notice patterns and internalize these algorithms better".
