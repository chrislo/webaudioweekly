Patatap (which we first saw way back in [issue 14](https://www.webaudioweekly.com/14)) is a collaboration between Jono Brandel and the band Lullatone. To celebrate its 7th anniversary(!) the team have released an updated version with MIDI support. There's a companion [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5igwpQIpi4) demoing integration with synths and Abelton.
