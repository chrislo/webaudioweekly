Hi! Welcome to Web Audio Weekly. My name's Chris Lowis. I started an
email newsletter back in 2013 to raise interest in a new API we were
working on in the
[W3C Audio XG](https://www.w3.org/2011/audio/). Since then, through
the work of some amazing engineers and the support of a growing
community of interested early adopters the
[Web Audio API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/) and
[Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/) are becoming
mature, full-featured additions to the web platform.

I collect news, demos and stories and share them with the community
here and [through my email newsletter](/subscribe). Please
[send me contributions by email](mailto:chris@webaudioweekly.com). You can also [find Web Audio Weekly on twitter](https://twitter.com/webaudioweekly).
